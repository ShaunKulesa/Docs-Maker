# NAME

tdbc::mapSqlState - Map SQLSTATE to error class

# SYNOPSIS

    package require tdbc 1.0

    tdbc::mapSqlState sqlstate

\

# DESCRIPTION

The **tdbc::mapSqlState** command accepts a string that is expected to
be a five-character \'SQL state\' as returned from a SQL database when
an error occurs. It examines the first two characters of the string, and
returns an error class as a human- and machine-readable name (for
example, **FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED**, **DATA_EXCEPTION** or
**INVALID_CURSOR_STATE**).

The TDBC specification requires database drivers to return a description
of an error in the error code when an error occurs. The description is a
string that has at least four elements: \"**TDBC** *errorClass*
*sqlstate* *driverName* *details\...*\". The **tdbc::mapSqlState**
command gives a convenient way for a TDBC driver to generate the
*errorClass* element given the SQL state returned from a database.
