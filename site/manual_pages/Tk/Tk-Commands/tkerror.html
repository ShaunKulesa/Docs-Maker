<p>tkerror - Command invoked to process background errors</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>tkerror</strong> <em>message</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Note: as of Tk 4.1 the <strong>tkerror</strong> command has been
renamed to <strong>bgerror</strong> because the event loop (which is
what usually invokes it) is now part of Tcl. For backward compatibility
the <strong>bgerror</strong> provided by the current Tk version still
tries to call <strong>tkerror</strong> if there is one (or an auto
loadable one), so old script defining that error handler should still
work, but you should anyhow modify your scripts to use
<strong>bgerror</strong> instead of <strong>tkerror</strong> because
that support for the old name might vanish in the near future. If that
call fails, <strong>bgerror</strong> posts a dialog showing the error
and offering to see the stack trace to the user. If you want your own
error management you should directly override <strong>bgerror</strong>
instead of <strong>tkerror</strong>. Documentation for
<strong>bgerror</strong> is available as part of Tcl's
documentation.</p>
