<p>clipboard - Manipulate Tk clipboard</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>clipboard</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command provides a Tcl interface to the Tk clipboard, which
stores data for later retrieval using the selection mechanism (via the
<strong>-selection CLIPBOARD</strong> option). In order to copy data
into the clipboard, <strong>clipboard clear</strong> must be called,
followed by a sequence of one or more calls to
<strong>clipboard</strong> append. To ensure that the clipboard is
updated atomically, all appends should be completed before returning to
the event loop.</p>
<p>The first argument to <strong>clipboard</strong> determines the
format of the rest of the arguments and the behavior of the command. The
following forms are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>clipboard append</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<strong>-format</strong> <em>format</em>?
?<strong>-type</strong> <em>type</em>? ?<strong>- -</strong>?
<em>data</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Appends <em>data</em> to the clipboard on <em>window</em>'s display
in the form given by <em>type</em> with the representation given by
<em>format</em> and claims ownership of the clipboard on
<em>window</em>'s display.</p>
<p><em>Type</em> specifies the form in which the selection is to be
returned (the desired for conversion, in ICCCM terminology), and should
be an atom name such as <strong>STRING</strong> or
<strong>FILE_NAME</strong>; see the Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual for complete details. <em>Type</em> defaults to
<strong>STRING</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>format</em> argument specifies the representation that should
be used to transmit the selection to the requester (the second column of
Table 2 of the ICCCM), and defaults to <strong>STRING</strong>. If
<em>format</em> is <strong>STRING</strong>, the selection is transmitted
as 8-bit ASCII characters. If <em>format</em> is <strong>ATOM</strong>,
then the <em>data</em> is divided into fields separated by white space;
each field is converted to its atom value, and the 32-bit atom value is
transmitted instead of the atom name. For any other <em>format</em>,
<em>data</em> is divided into fields separated by white space and each
field is converted to a 32-bit integer; an array of integers is
transmitted to the selection requester. Note that strings passed to
<strong>clipboard append</strong> are concatenated before conversion, so
the caller must take care to ensure appropriate spacing across string
boundaries. All items appended to the clipboard with the same
<em>type</em> must have the same <em>format</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>format</em> argument is needed only for compatibility with
clipboard requesters that do not use Tk. If the Tk toolkit is being used
to retrieve the <strong>CLIPBOARD</strong> selection then the value is
converted back to a string at the requesting end, so <em>format</em> is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>A <strong>- -</strong> argument may be specified to mark the end of
options: the next argument will always be used as <em>data</em>. This
feature may be convenient if, for example, <em>data</em> starts with a
<strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>clipboard clear</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Claims ownership of the clipboard on <em>window</em>'s display and
removes any previous contents. <em>Window</em> defaults to Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>clipboard get</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<strong>-type</strong> <em>type</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieve data from the clipboard on <em>window</em>'s display.
<em>Window</em> defaults to <em>Type</em> specifies the form in which
the data is to be returned and should be an atom name such as
<strong>STRING</strong> or <strong>FILE_NAME</strong>. <em>Type</em>
defaults to <strong>STRING</strong>. This command is equivalent to</p>
<p>Note that on modern X11 systems, the most useful type to retrieve for
transferred strings is not <strong>STRING</strong>, but rather
<strong>UTF8_STRING</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Get the current contents of the clipboard.</p>
<pre><code>if {[catch {clipboard get} contents]} {
    # There were no clipboard contents at all
}</code></pre>
<p>Set the clipboard to contain a fixed string.</p>
<pre><code>clipboard clear
clipboard append &quot;some fixed string&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can put custom data into the clipboard by using a custom
<strong>-type</strong> option. This is not necessarily portable, but can
be very useful. The method of passing Tcl scripts this way is effective,
but should be mixed with safe interpreters in production code.</p>
<pre><code># This is a very simple canvas serializer;
# it produces a script that recreates the item(s) when executed
proc getItemConfig {canvas tag} {
   set script {}
   foreach item [$canvas find withtag $tag] {
      append script {$canvas create } [$canvas type $item]
      append script { } [$canvas coords $item] { }
      foreach config [$canvas itemconf $item] {
         lassign $config name - - - value
         append script [list $name $value] { }
      }
      append script \n
   }
   return [string trim $script]
}

# Set up a binding on a canvas to cut and paste an item
set c [canvas .c]
pack $c
$c create text 150 30 -text &quot;cut and paste me&quot;
bind $c &lt;&lt;Cut&gt;&gt; {
   clipboard clear
   clipboard append -type TkCanvasItem \
         [getItemConfig %W current]
   # Delete because this is cut, not copy.
   %W delete current
}
bind $c &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {
   catch {
      set canvas %W
      eval [clipboard get -type TkCanvasItem]
   }
}</code></pre>
