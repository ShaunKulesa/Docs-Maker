<p>place - Geometry manager for fixed or rubber-sheet placement</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>place</strong> <em>option arg</em> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The placer is a geometry manager for Tk. It provides simple fixed
placement of windows, where you specify the exact size and location of
one window, called the <em>content</em>, within another window, called
the <em>container</em>. The placer also provides rubber-sheet placement,
where you specify the size and location of the content in terms of the
dimensions of the container, so that the content changes size and
location in response to changes in the size of the container. Lastly,
the placer allows you to mix these styles of placement so that, for
example, the content has a fixed width and height but is centered inside
the container.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>place</strong> <em>window option value</em> ?<em>option
value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for the placer to manage the geometry of a content whose
pathName is <em>window</em>. The remaining arguments consist of one or
more <em>option-value</em> pairs that specify the way in which
<em>window</em>'s geometry is managed. <em>Option</em> may have any of
the values accepted by the <strong>place configure</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>place configure</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the geometry options of the content given by
<em>window</em>. If no <em>option</em> is specified, this command
returns a list describing the available options (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to
have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty
string.</p>
<p>The following <em>option-value</em> pairs are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-anchor</strong> <em>where</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Where</em> specifies which point of <em>window</em> is to be
positioned at the (x,y) location selected by the <strong>-x</strong>,
<strong>-y</strong>, <strong>-relx</strong>, and <strong>-rely</strong>
options. The anchor point is in terms of the outer area of
<em>window</em> including its border, if any. Thus if <em>where</em> is
<strong>se</strong> then the lower-right corner of <em>window</em>'s
border will appear at the given (x,y) location in the container. The
anchor position defaults to <strong>nw</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-bordermode</strong> <em>mode</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Mode</em> determines the degree to which borders within the
container are used in determining the placement of the content. The
default and most common value is <strong>inside</strong>. In this case
the placer considers the area of the container to be the innermost area
of the container, inside any border: an option of <strong>-x 0</strong>
corresponds to an x-coordinate just inside the border and an option of
<strong>-relwidth 1.0</strong> means <em>window</em> will fill the area
inside the container's border.</p>
<p>If <em>mode</em> is <strong>outside</strong> then the placer
considers the area of the container to include its border; this mode is
typically used when placing <em>window</em> outside its container, as
with the options <strong>-x 0 -y 0 -anchor ne</strong>. Lastly,
<em>mode</em> may be specified as <strong>ignore</strong>, in which case
borders are ignored: the area of the container is considered to be its
official X area, which includes any internal border but no external
border. A bordermode of <strong>ignore</strong> is probably not very
useful.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-height</strong> <em>size</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the height for <em>window</em> in screen
units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>).
The height will be the outer dimension of <em>window</em> including its
border, if any. If <em>size</em> is an empty string, or if no
<strong>-height</strong> or <strong>-relheight</strong> option is
specified, then the height requested internally by the window will be
used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-in</strong> <em>container</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Container</em> specifies the path name of the window relative to
which <em>window</em> is to be placed. <em>Container</em> must either be
<em>window</em>'s parent or a descendant of <em>window</em>'s parent. In
addition, <em>container</em> and <em>window</em> must both be
descendants of the same top-level window. These restrictions are
necessary to guarantee that <em>window</em> is visible whenever
<em>container</em> is visible. If this option is not specified then the
other window defaults to <em>window</em>'s parent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-relheight</strong> <em>size</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the height for <em>window</em>. In this case
the height is specified as a floating-point number relative to the
height of the container: 0.5 means <em>window</em> will be half as high
as the container, 1.0 means <em>window</em> will have the same height as
the container, and so on. If both <strong>-height</strong> and
<strong>-relheight</strong> are specified for a content, their values
are summed. For example, <strong>-relheight 1.0 -height -2</strong>
makes the content 2 pixels shorter than the container.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-relwidth</strong> <em>size</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the width for <em>window</em>. In this case
the width is specified as a floating-point number relative to the width
of the container: 0.5 means <em>window</em> will be half as wide as the
container, 1.0 means <em>window</em> will have the same width as the
container, and so on. If both <strong>-width</strong> and
<strong>-relwidth</strong> are specified for a content, their values are
summed. For example, <strong>-relwidth 1.0 -width 5</strong> makes the
content 5 pixels wider than the container.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-relx</strong> <em>location</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the x-coordinate within the container
window of the anchor point for <em>window</em>. In this case the
location is specified in a relative fashion as a floating-point number:
0.0 corresponds to the left edge of the container and 1.0 corresponds to
the right edge of the container. <em>Location</em> need not be in the
range 0.0-1.0. If both <strong>-x</strong> and <strong>-relx</strong>
are specified for a content then their values are summed. For example,
<strong>-relx 0.5 -x -2</strong> positions the left edge of the content
2 pixels to the left of the center of its container.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-rely</strong> <em>location</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the y-coordinate within the container
window of the anchor point for <em>window</em>. In this case the value
is specified in a relative fashion as a floating-point number: 0.0
corresponds to the top edge of the container and 1.0 corresponds to the
bottom edge of the container. <em>Location</em> need not be in the range
0.0-1.0. If both <strong>-y</strong> and <strong>-rely</strong> are
specified for a content then their values are summed. For example,
<strong>-rely 0.5 -x 3</strong> positions the top edge of the content 3
pixels below the center of its container.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-width</strong> <em>size</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Size</em> specifies the width for <em>window</em> in screen units
(i.e. any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>). The
width will be the outer width of <em>window</em> including its border,
if any. If <em>size</em> is an empty string, or if no
<strong>-width</strong> or <strong>-relwidth</strong> option is
specified, then the width requested internally by the window will be
used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-x</strong> <em>location</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the x-coordinate within the container
window of the anchor point for <em>window</em>. The location is
specified in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>) and need not lie within the bounds of the
container window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-y</strong> <em>location</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Location</em> specifies the y-coordinate within the container
window of the anchor point for <em>window</em>. The location is
specified in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>) and need not lie within the bounds of the
container window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the same value is specified separately with two different options,
such as <strong>-x</strong> and <strong>-relx</strong>, then the most
recent option is used and the older one is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>place forget</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes the placer to stop managing the geometry of <em>window</em>.
As a side effect of this command <em>window</em> will be unmapped so
that it does not appear on the screen. If <em>window</em> is not
currently managed by the placer then the command has no effect. This
command returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>place info</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list giving the current configuration of <em>window</em>.
The list consists of <em>option-value</em> pairs in exactly the same
form as might be specified to the <strong>place configure</strong>
command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>place slaves</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of all the content windows for which <em>window</em>
is the container. If there is no content for <em>window</em> then an
empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<!-- -->
<dl>
<dt><strong>place content</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Synonym for <strong>place slaves</strong> <em>window</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the configuration of a window has been retrieved with
<strong>place info</strong>, that configuration can be restored later by
first using <strong>place forget</strong> to erase any existing
information for the window and then invoking <strong>place
configure</strong> with the saved information.</p>
<h1 id="fine-points">FINE POINTS</h1>
<p>It is not necessary for the container window to be the parent of the
content window. This feature is useful in at least two situations.
First, for complex window layouts it means you can create a hierarchy of
subwindows whose only purpose is to assist in the layout of the parent.
The of the parent (i.e. the windows that are significant for the
application's user interface) can be children of the parent yet be
placed inside the windows of the geometry-management hierarchy. This
means that the path names of the do not reflect the geometry-management
hierarchy and users can specify options for the real children without
being aware of the structure of the geometry-management hierarchy.</p>
<p>A second reason for having a container different than the content's
parent is to tie two siblings together. For example, the placer can be
used to force a window always to be positioned centered just below one
of its siblings by specifying the configuration</p>
<pre><code>-in sibling -relx 0.5 -rely 1.0 -anchor n -bordermode outside</code></pre>
<p>Whenever the sibling is repositioned in the future, the content will
be repositioned as well.</p>
<p>Unlike many other geometry managers (such as the packer) the placer
does not make any attempt to manipulate the geometry of the container
windows or the parents of content windows (i.e. it does not set their
requested sizes). To control the sizes of these windows, make them
windows like frames and canvases that provide configuration options for
this purpose.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Make the label occupy the middle bit of the toplevel, no matter how
it is resized:</p>
<pre><code>label .l -text &quot;In the\nMiddle!&quot; -bg black -fg white
place .l -relwidth .3 -relx .35 -relheight .3 -rely .35</code></pre>
