<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -aspect
Database Name:  aspect
Database Class: Aspect</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating desired aspect
ratio for the text. The aspect ratio is specified as 100*width/height.
100 means the text should be as wide as it is tall, 200 means the text
should be twice as wide as it is tall, 50 means the text should be twice
as tall as it is wide, and so on. Used to choose line length for text if
<strong>-width</strong> option is not specified. Defaults to 150.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -justify
Database Name:  justify
Database Class: Justify</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies how to justify lines of text. Must be one of
<strong>left</strong>, <strong>center</strong>, or
<strong>right</strong>. Defaults to <strong>left</strong>. This option
works together with the <strong>-anchor</strong>,
<strong>-aspect</strong>, <strong>-padx</strong>,
<strong>-pady</strong>, and <strong>-width</strong> options to provide a
variety of arrangements of the text within the window. The
<strong>-aspect</strong> and <strong>-width</strong> options determine
the amount of screen space needed to display the text. The
<strong>-anchor</strong>, <strong>-padx</strong>, and
<strong>-pady</strong> options determine where this rectangular area is
displayed within the widget's window, and the <strong>-justify</strong>
option determines how each line is displayed within that rectangular
region. For example, suppose <strong>-anchor</strong> is
<strong>e</strong> and <strong>-justify</strong> is
<strong>left</strong>, and that the message window is much larger than
needed for the text. The text will be displayed so that the left edges
of all the lines line up and the right edge of the longest line is
<strong>-padx</strong> from the right side of the window; the entire
text block will be centered in the vertical span of the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -width
Database Name:  width
Database Class: Width</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the length of lines in the window. The value may have any
of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>. If this option
has a value greater than zero then the <strong>-aspect</strong> option
is ignored and the <strong>-width</strong> option determines the line
length. If this option has a value less than or equal to zero, then the
<strong>-aspect</strong> option determines the line length.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>message</strong> command creates a new window (given by
the <em>pathName</em> argument) and makes it into a message widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the message such
as its colors, font, text, and initial relief. The
<strong>message</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em> argument.
At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
<em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A message is a widget that displays a textual string. A message
widget has three special features that differentiate it from a
<strong>label</strong> widget. First, it breaks up its string into lines
in order to produce a given aspect ratio for the window. The line breaks
are chosen at word boundaries wherever possible (if not even a single
word would fit on a line, then the word will be split across lines).
Newline characters in the string will force line breaks; they can be
used, for example, to leave blank lines in the display.</p>
<p>The second feature of a message widget is justification. The text may
be displayed left-justified (each line starts at the left side of the
window), centered on a line-by-line basis, or right-justified (each line
ends at the right side of the window).</p>
<p>The third feature of a message widget is that it handles control
characters and non-printing characters specially. Tab characters are
replaced with enough blank space to line up on the next 8-character
boundary. Newlines cause line breaks. Other control characters (ASCII
code less than 0x20) and characters not defined in the font are
displayed as a four-character sequence <strong>\x</strong><em>hh</em>
where <em>hh</em> is the two-digit hexadecimal number corresponding to
the character. In the unusual case where the font does not contain all
of the characters in then control characters and undefined characters
are not displayed at all.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>message</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is <em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<pre><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of
the command. The following commands are possible for message
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>message</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <em>pathName</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>message</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>When a new message is created, it has no default event bindings:
messages are intended for output purposes only.</p>
<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>Tabs do not work very well with text that is centered or
right-justified. The most common result is that the line is justified
wrong.</p>
