<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>send - Execute a command in a different application</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>send ?</strong><em>options</em>? <em>app cmd</em> ?<em>arg
arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command arranges for <em>cmd</em> (and <em>arg</em>s) to be
executed in the application named by <em>app</em>. It returns the result
or error from that command execution. <em>App</em> may be the name of
any application whose main window is on the display containing the
sender's main window; it need not be within the same process. If no
<em>arg</em> arguments are present, then the command to be executed is
contained entirely within the <em>cmd</em> argument. If one or more
<em>arg</em>s are present, they are concatenated to form the command to
be executed, just as for the <strong>eval</strong> command.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments of the command begin with they are treated
as options. The following options are currently defined:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-async</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Requests asynchronous invocation. In this case the
<strong>send</strong> command will complete immediately without waiting
for <em>cmd</em> to complete in the target application; no result will
be available and errors in the sent command will be ignored. If the
target application is in the same process as the sending application
then the <strong>-async</strong> option is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-displayof</strong> <em>pathName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the target application's main window is on the display
of the window given by <em>pathName</em>, instead of the display
containing the application's main window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>- -</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Serves no purpose except to terminate the list of options. This
option is needed only if <em>app</em> could contain a leading
character.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="application-names">APPLICATION NAMES</h1>
<p>The name of an application is set initially from the name of the
program or script that created the application. You can query and change
the name of an application with the <strong>tk appname</strong>
command.</p>
<h1 id="disabling-sends">DISABLING SENDS</h1>
<p>If the <strong>send</strong> command is removed from an application
(e.g. with the command <strong>rename</strong> <strong>send {}</strong>)
then the application will not respond to incoming send requests anymore,
nor will it be able to issue outgoing requests. Communication can be
reenabled by invoking the <strong>tk appname</strong> command.</p>
<h1 id="security">SECURITY</h1>
<p>The <strong>send</strong> command is potentially a serious security
loophole. On Unix, any application that can connect to your X server can
send scripts to your applications. These incoming scripts can use Tcl to
read and write your files and invoke subprocesses under your name.
Host-based access control such as that provided by
<strong>xhost</strong> is particularly insecure, since it allows anyone
with an account on particular hosts to connect to your server, and if
disabled it allows anyone anywhere to connect to your server. In order
to provide at least a small amount of security, Tk checks the access
control being used by the server and rejects incoming sends unless (a)
<strong>xhost</strong>-style access control is enabled (i.e. only
certain hosts can establish connections) and (b) the list of enabled
hosts is empty. This means that applications cannot connect to your
server unless they use some other form of authorization such as that
provide by <strong>xauth</strong>. Under Windows, <strong>send</strong>
is currently disabled. Most of the functionality is provided by the
<strong>dde</strong> command instead.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This script fragment can be used to make an application that only
runs once on a particular display.</p>
<pre><code>if {[tk appname FoobarApp] ne &quot;FoobarApp&quot;} {
    send -async FoobarApp RemoteStart $argv
    exit
}
# The command that will be called remotely, which raises
# the application main window and opens the requested files
proc RemoteStart args {
    raise .
    foreach filename $args {
        OpenFile $filename
    }
}</code></pre>
