<p>pack - Geometry manager that packs around edges of cavity</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>pack</strong> <em>option arg</em> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>pack</strong> command is used to communicate with the
packer, a geometry manager that arranges the children of a parent by
packing them in order around the edges of the parent. The
<strong>pack</strong> command can have any of several forms, depending
on the <em>option</em> argument:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>pack</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>window ...</em>?
?<em>options</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the first argument to <strong>pack</strong> is a window name (any
value starting with then the command is processed in the same way as
<strong>pack configure</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pack configure</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>window
...</em>? ?<em>options</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The arguments consist of the names of one or more content windows
followed by pairs of arguments that specify how to manage the content.
See <strong>THE PACKER ALGORITHM</strong> below for details on how the
options are used by the packer. The following options are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-after</strong> <em>other</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Other</em> must the name of another window. Use its container as
the container for the content, and insert the content just after
<em>other</em> in the packing order.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-anchor</strong> <em>anchor</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Anchor</em> must be a valid anchor position such as
<strong>n</strong> or <strong>sw</strong>; it specifies where to
position each content in its parcel. Defaults to
<strong>center</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-before</strong> <em>other</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Other</em> must the name of another window. Use its container as
the container for the content, and insert the content just before
<em>other</em> in the packing order.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-expand</strong> <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether the content should be expanded to consume extra
space in their container. <em>Boolean</em> may have any proper boolean
value, such as <strong>1</strong> or <strong>no</strong>. Defaults to
0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-fill</strong> <em>style</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If a content's parcel is larger than its requested dimensions, this
option may be used to stretch the content. <em>Style</em> must have one
of the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>none</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Give the content its requested dimensions plus any internal padding
requested with <strong>-ipadx</strong> or <strong>-ipady</strong>. This
is the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>x</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Stretch the content horizontally to fill the entire width of its
parcel (except leave external padding as specified by
<strong>-padx</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>y</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Stretch the content vertically to fill the entire height of its
parcel (except leave external padding as specified by
<strong>-pady</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>both</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Stretch the content both horizontally and vertically.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-in</strong> <em>container</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the window at the end of the packing order for the container
window given by <em>container</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-ipadx</strong> <em>amount</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much horizontal internal padding to
leave on each side of the content. <em>Amount</em> must be a valid
screen distance, such as <strong>2</strong> or <strong>.5c</strong>. It
defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-ipady</strong> <em>amount</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave
on each side of the content. <em>Amount</em> defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-padx</strong> <em>amount</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much horizontal external padding to
leave on each side of the content. <em>Amount</em> may be a list of two
values to specify padding for left and right separately. <em>Amount</em>
defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-pady</strong> <em>amount</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Amount</em> specifies how much vertical external padding to leave
on each side of the content. <em>Amount</em> may be a list of two values
to specify padding for top and bottom separately. <em>Amount</em>
defaults to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-side</strong> <em>side</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies which side of the container the content will be packed
against. Must be <strong>left</strong>, <strong>right</strong>,
<strong>top</strong>, or <strong>bottom</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>top</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If no <strong>-in</strong>, <strong>-after</strong> or
<strong>-before</strong> option is specified then each of the content
will be inserted at the end of the packing list for its parent unless it
is already managed by the packer (in which case it will be left where it
is). If one of these options is specified then all the content will be
inserted at the specified point. If any of the content are already
managed by the geometry manager then any unspecified options for them
retain their previous values rather than receiving default values.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pack forget</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>window
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes each of the <em>window</em>s from the packing order for its
container and unmaps their windows. The content will no longer be
managed by the packer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pack info</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of
the window given by <em>window</em> in the same option-value form that
might be specified to <strong>pack configure</strong>. The first two
elements of the list are where <em>container</em> is the window's
container.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pack propagate</strong> <em>container</em>
?<em>boolean</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>boolean</em> has a true boolean value such as
<strong>1</strong> or <strong>on</strong> then propagation is enabled
for <em>container</em>, which must be a window name (see
<strong>GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</strong> below). If <em>boolean</em> has a
false boolean value then propagation is disabled for <em>container</em>.
In either of these cases an empty string is returned. If
<em>boolean</em> is omitted then the command returns <strong>0</strong>
or <strong>1</strong> to indicate whether propagation is currently
enabled for <em>container</em>. Propagation is enabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pack slaves</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of all of the content windows in the packing order for
<em>window</em>. The order of the content windows in the list is the
same as their order in the packing order. If <em>window</em> has no
content then an empty string is returned.</p>

<h1 id="the-packer-algorithm">THE PACKER ALGORITHM</h1>
<p>For each container the packer maintains an ordered list of content
windows called the <em>packing list</em>. The <strong>-in</strong>,
<strong>-after</strong>, and <strong>-before</strong> configuration
options are used to specify the container for each content and the
content's position in the packing list. If none of these options is
given for a content then the content is added to the end of the packing
list for its parent.</p>
<p>The packer arranges the content windows for a container by scanning
the packing list in order. At the time it processes each content, a
rectangular area within the container is still unallocated. This area is
called the <em>cavity</em>; for the first content it is the entire area
of the container.</p>
<p>For each content the packer carries out the following steps:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The packer allocates a rectangular <em>parcel</em> for the content
along the side of the cavity given by the content's
<strong>-side</strong> option. If the side is top or bottom then the
width of the parcel is the width of the cavity and its height is the
requested height of the content plus the <strong>-ipady</strong> and
<strong>-pady</strong> options. For the left or right side the height of
the parcel is the height of the cavity and the width is the requested
width of the content plus the <strong>-ipadx</strong> and
<strong>-padx</strong> options. The parcel may be enlarged further
because of the <strong>-expand</strong> option (see
<strong>EXPANSION</strong> below)</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The packer chooses the dimensions of the content. The width will
normally be the content's requested width plus twice its
<strong>-ipadx</strong> option and the height will normally be the
content's requested height plus twice its <strong>-ipady</strong>
option. However, if the <strong>-fill</strong> option is
<strong>x</strong> or <strong>both</strong> then the width of the
content is expanded to fill the width of the parcel, minus twice the
<strong>-padx</strong> option. If the <strong>-fill</strong> option is
<strong>y</strong> or <strong>both</strong> then the height of the
content is expanded to fill the width of the parcel, minus twice the
<strong>-pady</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The packer positions the content over its parcel. If the content is
smaller than the parcel then the <strong>-anchor</strong> option
determines where in the parcel the content will be placed. If
<strong>-padx</strong> or <strong>-pady</strong> is non-zero, then the
given amount of external padding will always be left between the content
and the edges of the parcel.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once a given content has been packed, the area of its parcel is
subtracted from the cavity, leaving a smaller rectangular cavity for the
next content. If a content does not use all of its parcel, the unused
space in the parcel will not be used by subsequent content. If the
cavity should become too small to meet the needs of a content then the
content will be given whatever space is left in the cavity. If the
cavity shrinks to zero size, then all remaining content on the packing
list will be unmapped from the screen until the container window becomes
large enough to hold them again.</p>
<h2 id="expansion">EXPANSION</h2>
<p>If a container window is so large that there will be extra space left
over after all of its content have been packed, then the extra space is
distributed uniformly among all of the content for which the
<strong>-expand</strong> option is set. Extra horizontal space is
distributed among the expandable content whose <strong>-side</strong> is
<strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong>, and extra vertical
space is distributed among the expandable content whose
<strong>-side</strong> is <strong>top</strong> or
<strong>bottom</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="geometry-propagation">GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</h2>
<p>The packer normally computes how large a container must be to just
exactly meet the needs of its content, and it sets the requested width
and height of the container to these dimensions. This causes geometry
information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a top-level
window so that the entire sub-tree sizes itself to fit the needs of the
leaf windows. However, the <strong>pack propagate</strong> command may
be used to turn off propagation for one or more containers. If
propagation is disabled then the packer will not set the requested width
and height of the packer. This may be useful if, for example, you wish
for a container window to have a fixed size that you specify.</p>
<h1 id="restrictions-on-container-windows">RESTRICTIONS ON CONTAINER
WINDOWS</h1>
<p>The container for each content must either be the content's parent
(the default) or a descendant of the content's parent. This restriction
is necessary to guarantee that the content can be placed over any part
of its container that is visible without danger of the content being
clipped by its parent.</p>
<h1 id="packing-order">PACKING ORDER</h1>
<p>If the container for a content is not its parent then you must make
sure that the content is higher in the stacking order than the
container. Otherwise the container will obscure the content and it will
appear as if the content has not been packed correctly. The easiest way
to make sure the content is higher than the container is to create the
container window first: the most recently created window will be highest
in the stacking order. Or, you can use the <strong>raise</strong> and
<strong>lower</strong> commands to change the stacking order of either
the container or the content.</p>
