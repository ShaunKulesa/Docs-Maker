Variables used or set by Tk</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The following Tcl variables are either set or used by Tk at various
times in its execution:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>tk_library</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable holds the file name for a directory containing a
library of Tcl scripts related to Tk. These scripts include an
initialization file that is normally processed whenever a Tk application
starts up, plus other files containing procedures that implement default
behaviors for widgets.</p>
<p>The initial value of <strong>tk_library</strong> is set when Tk is
added to an interpreter; this is done by searching several different
directories until one is found that contains an appropriate Tk startup
script. If the <strong>TK_LIBRARY</strong> environment variable exists,
then the directory it names is checked first. If
<strong>TK_LIBRARY</strong> is not set or does not refer to an
appropriate directory, then Tk checks several other directories based on
a compiled-in default location, the location of the Tcl library
directory, the location of the binary containing the application, and
the current working directory.</p>
<p>The variable can be modified by an application to switch to a
different library.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk_patchLevel</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains a dot-separated sequence of decimal integers giving the
current patch level for Tk. The patch level is incremented for each new
release or patch, and it uniquely identifies an official version of
Tk.</p>
<p>This value is normally the same as the result of</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk_strictMotif</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable is set to zero by default. If an application sets it to
one, then Tk attempts to adhere as closely as possible to Motif
look-and-feel standards. For example, active elements such as buttons
and scrollbar sliders will not change color when the pointer passes over
them. Modern applications should not normally set this variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk_version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Tk sets this variable in the interpreter for each application. The
variable holds the current version number of the Tk library in the form
<em>major</em>.<em>minor</em>. <em>Major</em> and <em>minor</em> are
integers. The major version number increases in any Tk release that
includes changes that are not backward compatible (i.e.Â whenever
existing Tk applications and scripts may have to change to work with the
new release). The minor version number increases with each new release
of Tk, except that it resets to zero whenever the major version number
changes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="internal-and-debugging-variables">INTERNAL AND DEBUGGING
VARIABLES</h2>
<p>These variables should not normally be set by user code.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>tk::Priv</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable is an array containing several pieces of information
that are private to Tk. The elements of <strong>tk::Priv</strong> are
used by Tk library procedures and default bindings. They should not be
accessed by any code outside Tk.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk_textRedraw</strong></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>tk_textRelayout</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>These variables are set by text widgets when they have debugging
turned on. The values written to these variables can be used to test or
debug text widget operations. These variables are mostly used by Tk's
test suite.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="other-global-variables">OTHER GLOBAL VARIABLES</h1>
<p>The following variables are only guaranteed to exist in
<strong>wish</strong> executables; the Tk library does not define them
itself but many Tk environments do.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>geometry</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If set, contains the user-supplied geometry specification to use for
the main Tk window.</p>
</dd>
