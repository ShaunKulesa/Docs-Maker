<h1 id="widget-specific-options">WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS</h1>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -background
Database Name:  background
Database Class: Background</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is the same as the standard <strong>-background</strong>
option except that its value may also be specified as an empty string.
In this case, the widget will display no background or border, and no
colors will be consumed from its colormap for its background and
border.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -class
Database Name:  class
Database Class: Class</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a class for the window. This class will be used when
querying the option database for the window's other options, and it will
also be used later for other purposes such as bindings. Some window
managers display the class name for windows in their dock while some
others display the window title. The <strong>-class</strong> option may
not be changed with the <strong>configure</strong> widget command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -colormap
Database Name:  colormap
Database Class: Colormap</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a colormap to use for the window. The value may be either
<strong>new</strong>, in which case a new colormap is created for the
window and its children, or the name of another window (which must be on
the same screen and have the same visual as <em>pathName</em>), in which
case the new window will use the colormap from the specified window. If
the <strong>-colormap</strong> option is not specified, the new window
uses the default colormap of its screen. This option may not be changed
with the <strong>configure</strong> widget command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -container
Database Name:  container
Database Class: Container</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The value must be a boolean. If true, it means that this window will
be used as a container in which some other application will be embedded
(for example, a Tk toplevel can be embedded using the
<strong>-use</strong> option). The window will support the appropriate
window manager protocols for things like geometry requests. The window
should not have any children of its own in this application. This option
may not be changed with the <strong>configure</strong> widget
command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -height
Database Name:  height
Database Class: Height</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms
acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>. If this option is less than
or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -menu
Database Name:  menu
Database Class: Menu</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a menu widget to be used as a menubar. On the Macintosh,
the menubar will be displayed across the top of the main monitor. On
Microsoft Windows and all UNIX platforms, the menu will appear across
the toplevel window as part of the window dressing maintained by the
window manager.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -screen
Database Name:  
Database Class: </code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the screen on which to place the new window. Any valid
screen name may be used, even one associated with a different display.
Defaults to the same screen as its parent. This option is special in
that it may not be specified via the option database, and it may not be
modified with the <strong>configure</strong> widget command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -use
Database Name:  use
Database Class: Use</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is used for embedding. If the value is not an empty
string, it must be the window identifier of a container window,
specified as a hexadecimal string like the ones returned by the
<strong>winfo id</strong> command. The toplevel widget will be created
as a child of the given container instead of the root window for the
screen. If the container window is in a Tk application, it must be a
frame or toplevel widget for which the <strong>-container</strong>
option was specified. This option may not be changed with the
<strong>configure</strong> widget command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -visual
Database Name:  visual
Database Class: Visual</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies visual information for the new window in any of the forms
accepted by <strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong>. If this option is not
specified, the new window will use the default visual for its screen.
The <strong>-visual</strong> option may not be modified with the
<strong>configure</strong> widget command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -width
Database Name:  width
Database Class: Width</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms
acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>. If this option is less than
or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>toplevel</strong> command creates a new toplevel widget
(given by the <em>pathName</em> argument). Additional options, described
above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the toplevel such as its background color and
relief. The <strong>toplevel</strong> command returns the path name of
the new window.</p>
<p>A toplevel is similar to a <strong>frame</strong> except that it is
created as a top-level window: its X parent is the root window of a
screen rather than the logical parent from its Tk path name. The primary
purpose of a toplevel is to serve as a container for dialog boxes and
other collections of widgets. The only visible features of a toplevel
are its background color and an optional 3-D border to make the toplevel
appear raised or sunken.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>toplevel</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is the same as the path name of the toplevel's window. This command
may be used to invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form:</p>
<pre><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>PathName</em> is the name of the command, which is the same as
the toplevel widget's path name. <em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s
determine the exact behavior of the command. The following commands are
possible for toplevel widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>toplevel</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <em>pathName</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>toplevel</strong> command.</p>
</dd>

<h1 id="bindings">BINDINGS</h1>
<p>When a new toplevel is created, it has no default event bindings:
toplevels are not intended to be interactive.</p>
<p>Be aware that bindings on toplevels may receive events from
subwidgets.</p>
