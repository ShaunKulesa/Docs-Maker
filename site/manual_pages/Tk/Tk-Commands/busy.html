<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>tk busy</strong> command provides a simple means to block
pointer events from Tk widgets, while overriding the widget's cursor
with a configurable busy cursor. Note this command does not prevent
keyboard events from being sent to the widgets made busy.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>There are many times in applications where you want to temporarily
restrict what actions the user can take. For example, an application
could have a button that when pressed causes some processing to occur.
However, while the application is busy processing, you probably don't
want the user to be able to click the button again. You may also want
restrict the user from other tasks such as clicking a button.</p>
<p>The <strong>tk busy</strong> command lets you make Tk widgets busy.
This means that user interactions such as button clicks, moving the
mouse, typing at the keyboard, etc. are ignored by the widget. You can
set a special cursor (like a watch) that overrides the widget's normal
cursor, providing feedback that the application (widget) is temporarily
busy.</p>
<p>When a widget is made busy, the widget and all of its descendants
will ignore pointer events. It's easy to make an entire panel of widgets
busy. You can simply make the toplevel widget (such as busy. This is
easier and far much more efficient than recursively traversing the
widget hierarchy, disabling each widget and re-configuring its
cursor.</p>
<p>Often, the <strong>tk busy</strong> command can be used instead of
Tk's <strong>grab</strong> command. Unlike <strong>grab</strong> which
restricts all user interactions to one widget, with the <strong>tk
busy</strong> command you can have more than one widget active (for
example, a dialog and a button).</p>
<h2 id="example">EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>You can make several widgets busy by simply making its ancestor
widget busy using the <strong>hold</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code>frame .top
button .top.button; canvas .top.canvas
pack .top.button .top.canvas
pack .top
# . . .
tk busy hold .top
update</code></pre>
<p>All the widgets within <strong>.top</strong> (including
<strong>.top</strong>) are now busy. Using <strong>update</strong>
insures that <strong>tk busy</strong> command will take effect before
any other user events can occur.</p>
<p>When the application is no longer busy processing, you can allow user
interactions again and free any resources it allocated by the
<strong>forget</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code>tk busy forget .top</code></pre>
<p>The busy window has a configurable cursor. You can change the busy
cursor using the <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code>tk busy configure .top -cursor &quot;watch&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Destroying the widget will also clean up any resources allocated by
the <strong>tk</strong> busy command.</p>
<h1 id="operations">OPERATIONS</h1>
<p>The following operations are available for the <strong>tk
busy</strong> command:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>tk busy</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>option
value</em>?...</dt>
<dd>
<p>Shortcut for <strong>tk busy hold</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk busy hold</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>option
value</em>?...</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes the specified <em>window</em> (and its descendants in the Tk
window hierarchy) appear busy. <em>Window</em> must be a valid path name
of a Tk widget. A transparent window is put in front of the specified
window. This transparent window is mapped the next time idle tasks are
processed, and the specified window and its descendants will be blocked
from user interactions. Normally <strong>update</strong> should be
called immediately afterward to insure that the hold operation is in
effect before the application starts its processing. The following
configuration options are valid:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-cursor</strong> <em>cursorName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the cursor to be displayed when the widget is made busy.
<em>CursorName</em> can be in any form accepted by
<strong>Tk_GetCursor</strong>. The default cursor is
<strong>wait</strong> on Windows and <strong>watch</strong> on other
platforms.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk busy cget</strong> <em>window</em> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Queries the <strong>tk busy</strong> command configuration options
for <em>window</em>. <em>Window</em> must be the path name of a widget
previously made busy by the <strong>hold</strong> operation. The command
returns the present value of the specified <em>option</em>.
<em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
<strong>hold</strong> operation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk busy configure</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>option
value</em>?...</dt>
<dd>
<p>Queries or modifies the <strong>tk busy</strong> command
configuration options for <em>window</em>. <em>Window</em> must be the
path name of a widget previously made busy by the <strong>hold</strong>
operation. If no options are specified, a list describing all of the
available options for <em>window</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list) is returned. If <em>option</em> is specified with no
<em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one named
option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one or more
<em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the
given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns the empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the
values accepted by the <strong>hold</strong> operation.</p>
<p>Please note that the option database is referenced through
<em>window</em>. For example, if the widget <strong>.frame</strong> is
to be made busy, the busy cursor can be specified for it by either
<strong>option</strong> command:</p>
<pre><code>option add *frame.busyCursor gumby
option add *Frame.BusyCursor gumby</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk busy forget</strong> <em>window</em>
?<em>window</em>?...</dt>
<dd>
<p>Releases resources allocated by the <strong>tk busy</strong> command
for <em>window</em>, including the transparent window. User events will
again be received by <em>window</em>. Resources are also released when
<em>window</em> is destroyed. <em>Window</em> must be the name of a
widget specified in the <strong>hold</strong> operation, otherwise an
error is reported.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk busy current</strong> ?<em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the pathnames of all widgets that are currently busy. If a
<em>pattern</em> is given, only the path names of busy widgets matching
<em>pattern</em> are returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk busy status</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the status of a widget <em>window</em>. If <em>window</em>
presently can not receive user interactions, <strong>1</strong> is
returned, otherwise <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="event-handling">EVENT HANDLING</h1>
<h2 id="bindings">BINDINGS</h2>
<p>The event blocking feature is implemented by creating and mapping a
transparent window that completely covers the widget. When the busy
window is mapped, it invisibly shields the widget and its hierarchy from
all events that may be sent. Like Tk widgets, busy windows have widget
names in the Tk window hierarchy. This means that you can use the
<strong>bind</strong> command, to handle events in the busy window.</p>
<pre><code>tk busy hold .frame.canvas
bind .frame.canvas_Busy &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }</code></pre>
<p>Normally the busy window is a sibling of the widget. The name of the
busy window is where <em>widget</em> is the name of the widget to be
made busy. In the previous example, the pathname of the busy window is
The exception is when the widget is a toplevel widget (such as where the
busy window can't be made a sibling. The busy window is then a child of
the widget named where <em>widget</em> is the name of the toplevel
widget. In the following example, the pathname of the busy window is</p>
<pre><code>tk busy hold .
bind ._Busy &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }</code></pre>
<h2 id="enterleave-events">ENTER/LEAVE EVENTS</h2>
<p>Mapping and unmapping busy windows generates Enter/Leave events for
all widgets they cover. Please note this if you are tracking Enter/Leave
events in widgets.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-events">KEYBOARD EVENTS</h2>
<p>When a widget is made busy, the widget is prevented from gaining the
keyboard focus by a user clicking on it by the busy window. But if the
widget already had focus, it still may receive keyboard events. The
widget can also still receive focus through keyboard traversal. To
prevent this, you must move focus to another window and make sure the
focus can not go back to the widgets made busy (e.g. but restricting
focus to a cancel button).</p>
<pre><code>pack [frame .frame]
pack [text .frame.text]
tk busy hold .frame
pack [button .cancel -text &quot;Cancel&quot; -command exit]
focus .cancel
bind .cancel &lt;Tab&gt; {break}
bind .cancel &lt;Shift-Tab&gt; {break}
update</code></pre>
<p>The above example moves the focus from .frame immediately after
invoking the <strong>hold</strong> so that no keyboard events will be
sent to <strong>.frame</strong> or any of its descendants. It also makes
sure it's not possible to leave button <strong>.cancel</strong> using
the keyboard.</p>

<p>Note that the <strong>tk busy</strong> command does not currently
have any effect on OSX when Tk is built using Aqua support.</p>
