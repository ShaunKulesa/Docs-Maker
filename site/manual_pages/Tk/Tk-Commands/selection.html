<p>selection - Manipulate the X selection</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>selection</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command provides a Tcl interface to the X selection mechanism
and implements the full selection functionality described in the X
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM).</p>
<p>Note that for management of the <strong>CLIPBOARD</strong> selection
(see below), the <strong>clipboard</strong> command may also be
used.</p>
<p>The first argument to <strong>selection</strong> determines the
format of the rest of the arguments and the behavior of the command. The
following forms are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>selection clear</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<strong>-selection</strong> <em>selection</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>selection</em> exists anywhere on <em>window</em>'s display,
clear it so that no window owns the selection anymore.
<em>Selection</em> specifies the X selection that should be cleared, and
should be an atom name such as <strong>PRIMARY</strong> or
<strong>CLIPBOARD</strong>; see the Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual for complete details. <em>Selection</em> defaults to
<strong>PRIMARY</strong> and <em>window</em> defaults to Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>selection get</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<strong>-selection</strong> <em>selection</em>?
?<strong>-type</strong> <em>type</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Retrieves the value of <em>selection</em> from <em>window</em>'s
display and returns it as a result. <em>Selection</em> defaults to
<strong>PRIMARY</strong> and <em>window</em> defaults to <em>Type</em>
specifies the form in which the selection is to be returned (the desired
for conversion, in ICCCM terminology), and should be an atom name such
as <strong>STRING</strong> or <strong>FILE_NAME</strong>; see the
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual for complete details.
<em>Type</em> defaults to <strong>STRING</strong>. The selection owner
may choose to return the selection in any of several different
representation formats, such as <strong>STRING</strong>,
<strong>UTF8_STRING</strong>, <strong>ATOM</strong>,
<strong>INTEGER</strong>, etc. (this format is different than the
selection type; see the ICCCM for all the confusing details). If the
selection is returned in a non-string format, such as
<strong>INTEGER</strong> or <strong>ATOM</strong>, the
<strong>selection</strong> command converts it to string format as a
collection of fields separated by spaces: atoms are converted to their
textual names, and anything else is converted to hexadecimal integers.
Note that <strong>selection get</strong> does not retrieve the selection
in the <strong>UTF8_STRING</strong> format unless told to.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>selection handle</strong> ?<strong>-selection</strong>
<em>s</em>? ?<strong>-type</strong> <em>t</em>?
?<strong>-format</strong> <em>f</em>? <em>window command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a handler for selection requests, such that <em>command</em>
will be executed whenever selection <em>s</em> is owned by
<em>window</em> and someone attempts to retrieve it in the form given by
type <em>t</em> (e.g. <em>t</em> is specified in the <strong>selection
get</strong> command). <em>S</em> defaults to <strong>PRIMARY</strong>,
<em>t</em> defaults to <strong>STRING</strong>, and <em>f</em> defaults
to <strong>STRING</strong>. If <em>command</em> is an empty string then
any existing handler for <em>window</em>, <em>t</em>, and <em>s</em> is
removed. Note that when the selection is handled as type
<strong>STRING</strong> it is also automatically handled as type
<strong>UTF8_STRING</strong> as well.</p>
<p>When <em>selection</em> is requested, <em>window</em> is the
selection owner, and <em>type</em> is the requested type,
<em>command</em> will be executed as a Tcl command with two additional
numbers appended to it (with space separators). The two additional
numbers are <em>offset</em> and <em>maxChars</em>: <em>offset</em>
specifies a starting character position in the selection and
<em>maxChars</em> gives the maximum number of characters to retrieve.
The command should return a value consisting of at most
<em>maxChars</em> of the selection, starting at position
<em>offset</em>. For very large selections (larger than
<em>maxChars</em>) the selection will be retrieved using several
invocations of <em>command</em> with increasing <em>offset</em> values.
If <em>command</em> returns a string whose length is less than
<em>maxChars</em>, the return value is assumed to include all of the
remainder of the selection; if the length of <em>command</em>'s result
is equal to <em>maxChars</em> then <em>command</em> will be invoked
again, until it eventually returns a result shorter than
<em>maxChars</em>. The value of <em>maxChars</em> will always be
relatively large (thousands of characters).</p>
<p>If <em>command</em> returns an error then the selection retrieval is
rejected just as if the selection did not exist at all.</p>
<p>The <em>format</em> argument specifies the representation that should
be used to transmit the selection to the requester (the second column of
Table 2 of the ICCCM), and defaults to <strong>STRING</strong>. If
<em>format</em> is <strong>STRING</strong>, the selection is transmitted
as 8-bit ASCII characters (i.e. just in the form returned by
<em>command</em>, in the system <strong>encoding</strong>; the
<strong>UTF8_STRING</strong> format always uses UTF-8 as its encoding).
If <em>format</em> is <strong>ATOM</strong>, then the return value from
<em>command</em> is divided into fields separated by white space; each
field is converted to its atom value, and the 32-bit atom value is
transmitted instead of the atom name. For any other <em>format</em>, the
return value from <em>command</em> is divided into fields separated by
white space and each field is converted to a 32-bit integer; an array of
integers is transmitted to the selection requester.</p>
<p>The <em>format</em> argument is needed only for compatibility with
selection requesters that do not use Tk. If Tk is being used to retrieve
the selection then the value is converted back to a string at the
requesting end, so <em>format</em> is irrelevant.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>selection own</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<strong>-selection</strong> <em>selection</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>selection own</strong> ?<strong>-command</strong>
<em>command</em>? ?<strong>-selection</strong> <em>selection</em>?
<em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The first form of <strong>selection own</strong> returns the path
name of the window in this application that owns <em>selection</em> on
the display containing <em>window</em>, or an empty string if no window
in this application owns the selection. <em>Selection</em> defaults to
<strong>PRIMARY</strong> and <em>window</em> defaults to</p>
<p>The second form of <strong>selection own</strong> causes
<em>window</em> to become the new owner of <em>selection</em> on
<em>window</em>'s display, returning an empty string as result. The
existing owner, if any, is notified that it has lost the selection. If
<em>command</em> is specified, it is a Tcl script to execute when some
other window claims ownership of the selection away from
<em>window</em>. <em>Selection</em> defaults to PRIMARY.</p>

<h1 id="widget-facilities">WIDGET FACILITIES</h1>
<p>The <strong>text</strong>, <strong>entry</strong>,
<strong>ttk::entry</strong>, <strong>listbox</strong>,
<strong>spinbox</strong> and <strong>ttk::spinbox</strong> widgets have
the option <strong>-exportselection</strong>. If a widget has this
option set to boolean <strong>true</strong>, then (in an unsafe
interpreter) a selection made in the widget is automatically written to
the <strong>PRIMARY</strong> selection.</p>
<p>A GUI event, for example
<strong>&lt;&lt;PasteSelection&gt;&gt;</strong>, can copy the
<strong>PRIMARY</strong> selection to certain widgets. This copy is
implemented by a widget binding to the event. The binding script makes
appropriate calls to the <strong>selection</strong> command.</p>
<h1 id="portability-issues">PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<p>On X11, the <strong>PRIMARY</strong> selection is a system-wide
feature of the X server, allowing communication between different
processes that are X11 clients.</p>
<p>On Windows, the <strong>PRIMARY</strong> selection is not provided by
the system, but only by Tk, and so it is shared only between windows of
a parent interpreter and its child interpreters. It is not shared
between interpreters in different processes or different threads. Each
parent interpreter has a separate <strong>PRIMARY</strong> selection
that is shared only with its child interpreters which are not safe
interpreters.</p>
<h1 id="security">SECURITY</h1>
<p>A safe interpreter cannot read from the <strong>PRIMARY</strong>
selection because its <strong>selection</strong> command is hidden. For
this reason the <strong>PRIMARY</strong> selection cannot be written to
the Tk widgets of a safe interpreter.</p>
<p>A Tk widget can have its option <strong>-exportselection</strong> set
to boolean <strong>true</strong>, but in a safe interpreter this option
has no effect: writing from the widget to the <strong>PRIMARY</strong>
selection is disabled.</p>
<p>These are security features. A safe interpreter may run untrusted
code, and it is a security risk if this untrusted code can read or write
the <strong>PRIMARY</strong> selection used by other interpreters.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>On X11 platforms, one of the standard selections available is the
<strong>SECONDARY</strong> selection. Hardly anything uses it, but here
is how to read it using Tk:</p>
<pre><code>set selContents [selection get -selection SECONDARY]</code></pre>
<p>Many different types of data may be available for a selection; the
special type <strong>TARGETS</strong> allows you to get a list of
available types:</p>
<pre><code>foreach type [selection get -type TARGETS] {
   puts &quot;Selection PRIMARY supports type $type&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>To claim the selection, you must first set up a handler to supply the
data for the selection. Then you have to claim the selection...</p>
<pre><code># Set up the data handler ready for incoming requests
set foo &quot;This is a string with some data in it... blah blah&quot;
selection handle -selection SECONDARY . getData
proc getData {offset maxChars} {
   puts &quot;Retrieving selection starting at $offset&quot;
   return [string range $::foo $offset [expr {$offset+$maxChars-1}]]
}

# Now we grab the selection itself
puts &quot;Claiming selection&quot;
selection own -command lost -selection SECONDARY .
proc lost {} {
   puts &quot;Lost selection&quot;
}</code></pre>
