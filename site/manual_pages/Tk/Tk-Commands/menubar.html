<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and earlier releases to help
manage pulldown menus and to implement keyboard traversal of menus. In
Tk 4.0 and later releases they are no longer needed. Stubs for these
procedures have been retained for backward compatibility, but they have
no effect. You should remove calls to these procedures from your code,
since eventually the procedures will go away.</p>
<p>From Tk 8.0 onwards, you should instead construct your menubar as a
normal <strong>menu</strong> and then attach it to the
<strong>toplevel</strong> of your choice using the
<strong>-menu</strong> option of that widget.</p>
