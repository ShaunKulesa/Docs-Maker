<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command rings the bell on the display for <em>window</em> and
returns an empty string. If the <strong>-displayof</strong> option is
omitted, the display of the application's main window is used by
default. The command uses the current bell-related settings for the
display, which may be modified with programs such as
<strong>xset</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>-nice</strong> is not specified, this command also resets
the screen saver for the screen. Some screen savers will ignore this,
but others will reset so that the screen becomes visible again.</p>
