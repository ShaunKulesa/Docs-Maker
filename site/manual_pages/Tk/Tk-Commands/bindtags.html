<p>bindtags - Determine which bindings apply to a window, and order of
evaluation</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>bindtags</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>tagList</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>When a binding is created with the <strong>bind</strong> command, it
is associated either with a particular window such as
<strong>.a.b.c</strong>, a class name such as <strong>Button</strong>,
the keyword <strong>all</strong>, or any other string. All of these
forms are called <em>binding tags</em>. Each window contains a list of
binding tags that determine how events are processed for the window.
When an event occurs in a window, it is applied to each of the window's
tags in order: for each tag, the most specific binding that matches the
given tag and event is executed. See the <strong>bind</strong> command
for more information on the matching process.</p>
<p>By default, each window has four binding tags consisting of the name
of the window, the window's class name, the name of the window's nearest
toplevel ancestor, and <strong>all</strong>, in that order. Toplevel
windows have only three tags by default, since the toplevel name is the
same as that of the window. The <strong>bindtags</strong> command allows
the binding tags for a window to be read and modified.</p>
<p>If <strong>bindtags</strong> is invoked with only one argument, then
the current set of binding tags for <em>window</em> is returned as a
list. If the <em>tagList</em> argument is specified to
<strong>bindtags</strong>, then it must be a proper list; the tags for
<em>window</em> are changed to the elements of the list. The elements of
<em>tagList</em> may be arbitrary strings; however, any tag starting
with a dot is treated as the name of a window; if no window by that name
exists at the time an event is processed, then the tag is ignored for
that event. The order of the elements in <em>tagList</em> determines the
order in which binding scripts are executed in response to events. For
example, the command</p>
<pre><code>bindtags .b {all . Button .b}</code></pre>
<p>reverses the order in which binding scripts will be evaluated for a
button named <strong>.b</strong> so that <strong>all</strong> bindings
are invoked first, following by bindings for <strong>.b</strong>'s
toplevel followed by class bindings, followed by bindings for
<strong>.b</strong>. If <em>tagList</em> is an empty list then the
binding tags for <em>window</em> are returned to the default state
described above.</p>
<p>The <strong>bindtags</strong> command may be used to introduce
arbitrary additional binding tags for a window, or to remove standard
tags. For example, the command</p>
<pre><code>bindtags .b {.b TrickyButton . all}</code></pre>
<p>replaces the <strong>Button</strong> tag for <strong>.b</strong> with
<strong>TrickyButton</strong>. This means that the default widget
bindings for buttons, which are associated with the
<strong>Button</strong> tag, will no longer apply to
<strong>.b</strong>, but any bindings associated with
<strong>TrickyButton</strong> (perhaps some new button behavior) will
apply.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>If you have a set of nested <strong>frame</strong> widgets and you
want events sent to a <strong>button</strong> widget to also be
delivered to all the widgets up to the current <strong>toplevel</strong>
(in contrast to Tk's default behavior, where events are not delivered to
those intermediate windows) to make it easier to have accelerators that
are only active for part of a window, you could use a helper procedure
like this to help set things up:</p>
<pre><code>proc setupBindtagsForTreeDelivery {widget} {
    set tags [list $widget [winfo class $widget]]
    set w $widget
    set t [winfo toplevel $w]
    while {$w ne $t} {
        set w [winfo parent $w]
        lappend tags $w
    }
    lappend tags all
    bindtags $widget $tags
}</code></pre>
