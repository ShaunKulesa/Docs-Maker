<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>tk_focusNext</strong> is a utility procedure used for
keyboard traversal. It returns the window after <em>window</em> in focus
order. The focus order is determined by the stacking order of windows
and the structure of the window hierarchy. Among siblings, the focus
order is the same as the stacking order, with the lowest window being
first. If a window has children, the window is visited first, followed
by its children (recursively), followed by its next sibling. Top-level
windows other than <em>window</em> are skipped, so that
<strong>tk_focusNext</strong> never returns a window in a different
top-level from <em>window</em>.</p>
<p>After computing the next window, <strong>tk_focusNext</strong>
examines the window's <strong>-takefocus</strong> option to see whether
it should be skipped. If so, <strong>tk_focusNext</strong> continues on
to the next window in the focus order, until it eventually finds a
window that will accept the focus or returns back to
<em>window</em>.</p>
<p><strong>tk_focusPrev</strong> is similar to
<strong>tk_focusNext</strong> except that it returns the window just
before <em>window</em> in the focus order.</p>
<p><strong>tk_focusFollowsMouse</strong> changes the focus model for the
application to an implicit one where the window under the mouse gets the
focus. After this procedure is called, whenever the mouse enters a
window Tk will automatically give it the input focus. The
<strong>focus</strong> command may be used to move the focus to a window
other than the one under the mouse, but as soon as the mouse moves into
a new window the focus will jump to that window. Note: at present there
is no built-in support for returning the application to an explicit
focus model; to do this you will have to write a script that deletes the
bindings created by <strong>tk_focusFollowsMouse</strong>.</p>
