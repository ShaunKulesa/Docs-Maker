<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>spinbox</strong> command creates a new window (given by
the <em>pathName</em> argument) and makes it into a spinbox widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the spinbox such
as its colors, font, and relief. The <strong>spinbox</strong> command
returns its <em>pathName</em> argument. At the time this command is
invoked, there must not exist a window named <em>pathName</em>, but
<em>pathName</em>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A <strong>spinbox</strong> is an extended <strong>entry</strong>
widget that allows he user to move, or spin, through a fixed set of
ascending or descending values such as times or dates in addition to
editing the value as in an <strong>entry</strong>. When first created, a
spinbox's string is empty. A portion of the spinbox may be selected as
described below. If a spinbox is exporting its selection (see the
<strong>-exportselection</strong> option), then it will observe the
standard protocols for handling the selection; spinbox selections are
available as type <strong>STRING</strong>. Spinboxes also observe the
standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus. When a spinbox has
the input focus it displays an <em>insertion cursor</em> to indicate
where new characters will be inserted.</p>
<p>Spinboxes are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit
entirely within the widget's window. In this case, only a portion of the
string will be displayed; commands described below may be used to change
the view in the window. Spinboxes use the standard
<strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> mechanism for interacting with
scrollbars (see the description of the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong>
option for details). They also support scanning, as described below.</p>
<h1 id="validation">VALIDATION</h1>
<p>Validation works by setting the <strong>-validatecommand</strong>
option to a script which will be evaluated according to the
<strong>-validate</strong> option as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>
<p>Default. This means no validation will occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focus</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-validatecommand</strong> will be called when the spinbox
receives or loses focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusin</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-validatecommand</strong> will be called when the spinbox
receives focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-validatecommand</strong> will be called when the spinbox
loses focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>key</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-validatecommand</strong> will be called when the spinbox
is edited.</p>
</dd>
<dt>all</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-validatecommand</strong> will be called for all above
conditions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> and <strong>-invalidcommand</strong>
scripts, just as you would in a <strong>bind</strong> script. The
following substitutions are recognized:</p>
<dl>
<dt>%d</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of action: 1 for <strong>insert</strong>, 0 for
<strong>delete</strong>, or -1 for focus, forced or textvariable
validation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%i</dt>
<dd>
<p>Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise
-1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%P</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value of the spinbox should edition occur. If you are configuring
the spinbox widget to have a new textvariable, this will be the value of
that textvariable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s</dt>
<dd>
<p>The current value of spinbox before edition.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%S</dt>
<dd>
<p>The text string being inserted/deleted, if any. Otherwise it is an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%v</dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of validation currently set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%V</dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin,
focusout, forced).</p>
</dd>
<dt>%W</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the spinbox widget.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In general, the <strong>-textvariable</strong> and
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> can be dangerous to mix. Any problems
have been overcome so that using the <strong>-validatecommand</strong>
will not interfere with the traditional behavior of the spinbox widget.
Using the <strong>-textvariable</strong> for read-only purposes will
never cause problems. The danger comes when you try set the
<strong>-textvariable</strong> to something that the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> would not accept, which causes
<strong>-validate</strong> to become <strong>none</strong> (the
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong> will not be triggered). The same
happens when an error occurs evaluating the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong>.</p>
<p>Primarily, an error will occur when the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> or <strong>-invalidcommand</strong>
encounters an error in its script while evaluating or
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> does not return a valid Tcl boolean
value. The <strong>-validate</strong> option will also set itself to
<strong>none</strong> when you edit the spinbox widget from within
either the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> or the
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong>. Such editions will override the one
that was being validated. If you wish to edit the value of the widget
during validation and still have the <strong>-validate</strong> option
set, you should include the command</p>
<pre><code>     %W config -validate %v</code></pre>
<p>in the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> or
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong> (whichever one you were editing the
spinbox widget from). It is also recommended to not set an associated
<strong>-textvariable</strong> during validation, as that can cause the
spinbox widget to become out of sync with the
<strong>-textvariable</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, the <strong>-validate</strong> option will set itself to
<strong>none</strong> when the spinbox value gets changed because of
adjustment of <strong>-from</strong> or <strong>-to</strong> and the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> returns false. For instance</p>
<pre><code>     spinbox pathName -from 1 -to 10 -validate all -vcmd {return 0}</code></pre>
<p>will in fact set the <strong>-validate</strong> option to
<strong>none</strong> because the default value for the spinbox gets
changed (due to the <strong>-from</strong> and <strong>-to</strong>
options) to a value not accepted by the validation script.</p>
<p>Moreover, forced validation is performed when invoking any spinbutton
of the spinbox. If the validation script returns false in this
situation, then the <strong>-validate</strong> option will be
automatically set to <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>spinbox</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is <em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<pre><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of
the command.</p>
<h2 id="indices">INDICES</h2>
<p>Many of the widget commands for spinboxes take one or more indices as
arguments. An index specifies a particular character in the spinbox's
string, in any of the following ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>number</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to
the first character in the string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>anchor</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
<strong>select from</strong> and <strong>select adjust</strong> widget
commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>end</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the spinbox's
string. This is equivalent to specifying a numerical index equal to the
length of the spinbox's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>insert</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the
insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sel.first</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the first character in the selection. It is an error to use
this form if the selection is not in the spinbox window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sel.last</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection. It
is an error to use this form if the selection is not in the spinbox
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><span class="citation"
data-cites="*">@*</span></strong>number*</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form, <em>number</em> is treated as an x-coordinate in the
spinbox's window; the character spanning that x-coordinate is used. For
example, indicates the left-most character in the window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g. or In
general, out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest
legal value.</p>
<h2 id="subcommands">SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<p>The following commands are possible for spinbox widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>bbox</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
character given by <em>index</em>. The first two elements of the list
give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen area
covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last
two elements give the width and height of the character, in pixels. The
bounding box may refer to a region outside the visible area of the
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>spinbox</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <em>pathName</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>spinbox</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>delete</strong> <em>first</em>
?<em>last</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delete one or more elements of the spinbox. <em>First</em> is the
index of the first character to delete, and <em>last</em> is the index
of the character just after the last one to delete. If <em>last</em> is
not specified it defaults to <em>first</em>+1, i.e. a single character
is deleted. This command returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>get</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the spinbox's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>icursor</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the
character given by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>identify</strong> <em>x y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the window element corresponding to coordinates
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in the spinbox. Return value is one of:
<strong>none</strong>, <strong>buttondown</strong>,
<strong>buttonup</strong>, <strong>entry</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>index</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the numerical index corresponding to <em>index</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>insert</strong> <em>index string</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the characters of <em>string</em> just before the character
indicated by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>invoke</strong> <em>element</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes the specified element, either <strong>buttondown</strong> or
<strong>buttonup</strong>, to be invoked, triggering the action
associated with it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan</strong> <em>option args</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to implement scanning on spinboxes. It has two
forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan mark</strong> <em>x</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Records <em>x</em> and the current view in the spinbox window; used
in conjunction with later <strong>scan dragto</strong> commands.
Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press in the
widget. It returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan dragto</strong> <em>x</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command computes the difference between its <em>x</em> argument
and the <em>x</em> argument to the last <strong>scan mark</strong>
command for the widget. It then adjusts the view left or right by 10
times the difference in x-coordinates. This command is typically
associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce the effect
of dragging the spinbox at high speed through the window. The return
value is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection</strong> <em>option
arg</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to adjust the selection within a spinbox. It has
several forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection adjust</strong>
<em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character given by
<em>index</em>, and adjust that end of the selection to be at
<em>index</em> (i.e. including but not going beyond <em>index</em>). The
other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future
<strong>select to</strong> commands. If the selection is not currently
in the spinbox, then a new selection is created to include the
characters between <em>index</em> and the most recent selection anchor
point, inclusive. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection clear</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget. If the
selection is not in this widget then the command has no effect. Returns
an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection element</strong>
?<em>element</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets or gets the currently selected element. If a spinbutton element
is specified, it will be displayed depressed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection from</strong>
<em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the selection anchor point to just before the character given by
<em>index</em>. Does not change the selection. Returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection present</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the spinbox, 0 if
nothing is selected.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection range</strong> <em>start
end</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the one
indexed by <em>start</em> and ending with the one just before
<em>end</em>. If <em>end</em> refers to the same character as
<em>start</em> or an earlier one, then the spinbox's selection is
cleared.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection to</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>index</em> is before the anchor point, set the selection to
the characters from <em>index</em> up to but not including the anchor
point. If <em>index</em> is the same as the anchor point, do nothing. If
<em>index</em> is after the anchor point, set the selection to the
characters from the anchor point up to but not including <em>index</em>.
The anchor point is determined by the most recent <strong>select
from</strong> or <strong>select adjust</strong> command in this widget.
If the selection is not in this widget then a new selection is created
using the most recent anchor point specified for the widget. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>set</strong> ?<em>string</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>string</em> is specified, the spinbox will try and set it to
this value, otherwise it just returns the spinbox's string. If
validation is on, it will occur when setting the string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>validate</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to force an evaluation of the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> independent of the conditions
specified by the <strong>-validate</strong> option. This is done by
temporarily setting the <strong>-validate</strong> option to
<strong>all</strong>. It returns 0 or 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview</strong> <em>args</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
the text in the widget's window. It can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal span
that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2
and the second element is .6, 20% of the spinbox's text is off-screen to
the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text
is off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to
scrollbars via the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by
<em>index</em> is displayed at the left edge of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview moveto</strong>
<em>fraction</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character
<em>fraction</em> of the way through the text appears at the left edge
of the window. <em>Fraction</em> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview scroll</strong> <em>number
what</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right
by <em>number</em> average-width characters on the display; if it is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by <em>number</em>
screenfuls. If <em>number</em> is negative then characters farther to
the left become visible; if it is positive then characters farther to
the right become visible.</p>

<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for spinboxes that give them
the following default behavior. In the descriptions below, refers to a
contiguous group of letters, digits, or characters, or any single
character other than these.</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before
the character underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this
widget, and clears any selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse
button 1 strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the
character under the mouse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse
and positions the insertion cursor at the beginning of the word.
Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection consisting of
whole words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the
spinbox and positions the insertion cursor before the first
character.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse
button 1 while the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of the
selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was
pressed. If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the
selection will be adjusted in units of whole words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position the
insertion cursor in the spinbox without affecting the selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If any normal printing characters are typed in a spinbox, they are
inserted at the point of the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The view in the spinbox can be adjusted by dragging with the middle

<p>The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to
the left or right; they also clear any selection in the spinbox and set
the selection anchor. If Left or Right is typed with the Shift key down,
then the insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include
the new character. Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion
cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the
insertion cursor by words and also extend the selection. Control-b and
Control-f behave the same as Left and Right, respectively. Meta-b and
Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control-Right,
respectively.</p>

<dd>
<p>The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the
position of the insertion cursor. They do not affect the current
selection. Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection to
the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor
to the insertion cursor if there was not any selection previously.</p>

<p>The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies
the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a
selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[16]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w
copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the
selection. If there is no selection in the widget then these keys have
no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[17]</dt>

<p>The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is one
in the spinbox. If there is no selection, it deletes the character to

<p>Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion
cursor.</p>

<dt>[22]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion
cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[23]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of
the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the spinbox is disabled using the <strong>-state</strong> option,
then the spinbox's view can still be adjusted and text in the spinbox
can still be selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no
text modifications will take place.</p>
<p>The behavior of spinboxes can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
