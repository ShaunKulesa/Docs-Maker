<p>ttk::intro - Introduction to the Tk theme engine</p>
<h1 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>The Tk themed widget set is based on a revised and enhanced version
of TIP #48 (https://tip.tcl-lang.org/48) specified style engine. The
main concepts are described below. The basic idea is to separate, to the
extent possible, the code implementing a widget's behavior from the code
implementing its appearance. Widget class bindings are primarily
responsible for maintaining the widget state and invoking callbacks; all
aspects of the widget's appearance are controlled by the style of the
widget (i.e. the style of the elements of the widget).</p>
<h1 id="themes">THEMES</h1>
<p>A <em>theme</em> is a collection of elements and styles that
determine the look and feel of the widget set. Themes can be used
to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>isolate platform differences (X11 vs. classic Windows vs. XP vs.
Aqua ...)</p></li>
<li><p>adapt to display limitations (low-color, grayscale, monochrome,
tiny screens)</p></li>
<li><p>accessibility (high contrast, large type)</p></li>
<li><p>application suite branding</p></li>
<li><p>blend in with the rest of the desktop (Gnome, KDE, Java)</p></li>
<li><p>and, of course: eye candy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="elements">ELEMENTS</h1>
<p>An <em>element</em> displays an individual part of a widget. For
example, a vertical scrollbar widget contains <strong>uparrow</strong>,
<strong>downarrow</strong>, <strong>trough</strong> and
<strong>slider</strong> elements.</p>
<p>Element names use a recursive dotted notation. For example,
<strong>uparrow</strong> identifies a generic arrow element, and
<strong>Scrollbar.uparrow</strong> and <strong>Combobox.uparrow</strong>
identify widget-specific elements. When looking for an element, the
style engine looks for the specific name first, and if an element of
that name is not found it looks for generic elements by stripping off
successive leading components of the element name.</p>
<p>Like widgets, elements have <em>options</em> which specify what to
display and how to display it. For example, the <strong>text</strong>
element (which displays a text string) has <strong>-text</strong>,
<strong>-font</strong>, <strong>-foreground</strong>,
<strong>-background</strong>, <strong>-underline</strong>, and
<strong>-width</strong> options. The value of an element option is taken
from (in precedence order):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an option of the same name and type in the widget containing the
element;</p></li>
<li><p>a dynamic setting specified by <strong>style map</strong> and the
current state;</p></li>
<li><p>the default setting specified by <strong>style
configure</strong>; or</p></li>
<li><p>the element's built-in default value for the option.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="layouts">LAYOUTS</h1>
<p>A <em>layout</em> specifies which elements make up a widget and how
they are arranged. The layout engine uses a simplified version of the
<strong>pack</strong> algorithm: starting with an initial cavity equal
to the size of the widget, elements are allocated a parcel within the
cavity along the side specified by the <strong>-side</strong> option,
and placed within the parcel according to the <strong>-sticky</strong>
option. For example, the layout for a horizontal scrollbar is:</p>
<pre><code>ttk::style layout Horizontal.TScrollbar {
    Scrollbar.trough -children {
    Scrollbar.leftarrow -side left -sticky w
    Scrollbar.rightarrow -side right -sticky e
    Scrollbar.thumb -sticky ew
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>By default, the layout for a widget is the same as its class name.
Some widgets may override this (for example, the
<strong>ttk::scrollbar</strong> widget chooses different layouts based
on the <strong>-orient</strong> option).</p>
<h1 id="states">STATES</h1>
<p>In standard Tk, many widgets have a <strong>-state</strong> option
which (in most cases) is either <strong>normal</strong> or
<strong>disabled</strong>. Some widgets support additional states, such
as the <strong>entry</strong> widget which has a
<strong>readonly</strong> state and the various flavors of buttons which
have <strong>active</strong> state.</p>
<p>The themed Tk widgets generalizes this idea: every widget has a
bitmap of independent state flags. Widget state flags include
<strong>active</strong>, <strong>disabled</strong>,
<strong>pressed</strong>, <strong>focus</strong>, etc., (see
<em>ttk::widget(n)</em> for the full list of state flags).</p>
<p>Instead of a <strong>-state</strong> option, every widget now has a
<strong>state</strong> widget command which is used to set or query the
state. A <em>state specification</em> is a list of symbolic state names
indicating which bits are set, each optionally prefixed with an
exclamation point indicating that the bit is cleared instead.</p>
<p>For example, the class bindings for the <strong>ttk::button</strong>
widget are:</p>
<pre><code>bind TButton &lt;Enter&gt;       { %W state active }
bind TButton &lt;Leave&gt;      { %W state !active }
bind TButton &lt;ButtonPress-1&gt;  { %W state pressed }
bind TButton &lt;Button1-Leave&gt;  { %W state !pressed }
bind TButton &lt;Button1-Enter&gt;  { %W state pressed }
bind TButton &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;    \
    { %W instate {pressed} { %W state !pressed ; %W invoke } }</code></pre>
<p>This specifies that the widget becomes <strong>active</strong> when
the pointer enters the widget, and inactive when it leaves. Similarly it
becomes <strong>pressed</strong> when the mouse button is pressed, and
<strong>!pressed</strong> on the ButtonRelease event. In addition, the
button unpresses if pointer is dragged outside the widget while Button-1
is held down, and represses if it's dragged back in. Finally, when the
mouse button is released, the widget's <strong>-command</strong> is
invoked, but only if the button is currently in the
<strong>pressed</strong> state. (The actual bindings are a little more
complicated than the above, but not by much).</p>
<h1 id="styles">STYLES</h1>
<p>Each widget is associated with a <em>style</em>, which specifies
values for element options. Style names use a recursive dotted notation
like layouts and elements; by default, widgets use the class name to
look up a style in the current theme. For example:</p>
<pre><code>ttk::style configure TButton \
    -background #d9d9d9 \
    -foreground black \
    -relief raised \
    ;</code></pre>
<p>Many elements are displayed differently depending on the widget
state. For example, buttons have a different background when they are
active, a different foreground when disabled, and a different relief
when pressed. The <strong>style map</strong> command specifies dynamic
option settings for a particular style:</p>
<pre><code>ttk::style map TButton \
    -background [list disabled #d9d9d9  active #ececec] \
    -foreground [list disabled #a3a3a3] \
    -relief [list {pressed !disabled} sunken] \
    ;</code></pre>
