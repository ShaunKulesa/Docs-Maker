<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A photo is an image whose pixels can display any color or be
transparent. A photo image is stored internally in full color (32 bits
per pixel), and is displayed using dithering if necessary. Image data
for a photo image can be obtained from a file or a string, or it can be
supplied from C code through a procedural interface. At present,
only</p>
<p>PNG,</p>
<p>GIF and PPM/PGM formats are supported, but an interface exists to
allow additional image file formats to be added easily. A photo image is
transparent in regions where no image data has been supplied or where it
has been set transparent by the <strong>transparency set</strong>
subcommand.</p>
<h1 id="creating-photos">CREATING PHOTOS</h1>
<p>Like all images, photos are created using the <strong>image
create</strong> command. Photos support the following
<em>options</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-data</strong> <em>string</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the contents of the image as a string. The string should
contain binary data or, for some formats, base64-encoded data (this is
currently guaranteed to be supported for PNG and GIF images). The format
of the string must be one of those for which there is an image file
format handler that will accept string data. If both the
<strong>-data</strong> and <strong>-file</strong> options are specified,
the <strong>-file</strong> option takes precedence.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-format</strong> <em>format-name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the file format for the data specified with the
<strong>-data</strong> or <strong>-file</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-file</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>name</em> gives the name of a file that is to be read to supply
data for the photo image. The file format must be one of those for which
there is an image file format handler that can read data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-gamma</strong> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the colors allocated for displaying this image in a
window should be corrected for a non-linear display with the specified
gamma exponent value. (The intensity produced by most CRT displays is a
power function of the input value, to a good approximation; gamma is the
exponent and is typically around 2). The value specified must be greater
than zero. The default value is one (no correction). In general, values
greater than one will make the image lighter, and values less than one
will make it darker.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-height</strong> <em>number</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the height of the image, in pixels. This option is useful
primarily in situations where the user wishes to build up the contents
of the image piece by piece. A value of zero (the default) allows the
image to expand or shrink vertically to fit the data stored in it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-palette</strong> <em>palette-spec</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the resolution of the color cube to be allocated for
displaying this image, and thus the number of colors used from the
colormaps of the windows where it is displayed. The
<em>palette-spec</em> string may be either a single decimal number,
specifying the number of shades of gray to use, or three decimal numbers
separated by slashes (/), specifying the number of shades of red, green
and blue to use, respectively. If the first form (a single number) is
used, the image will be displayed in monochrome (i.e., grayscale).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-width</strong> <em>number</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the width of the image, in pixels. This option is useful
primarily in situations where the user wishes to build up the contents
of the image piece by piece. A value of zero (the default) allows the
image to expand or shrink horizontally to fit the data stored in it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="image-command">IMAGE COMMAND</h1>
<p>When a photo image is created, Tk also creates a new command whose
name is the same as the image. This command may be used to invoke
various operations on the image. It has the following general form:</p>
<pre><code>imageName option ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of
the command.</p>
<p>Those options that write data to the image generally expand the size
of the image, if necessary, to accommodate the data written to the
image, unless the user has specified non-zero values for the
<strong>-width</strong> and/or <strong>-height</strong> configuration
options, in which case the width and/or height, respectively, of the
image will not be changed.</p>
<p>The following commands are possible for photo images:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>blank</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Blank the image; that is, set the entire image to have no data, so it
will be displayed as transparent, and the background of whatever window
it is displayed in will show through.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>image create</strong> <strong>photo</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options for the image. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <em>imageName</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to
have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty
string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
<strong>image create</strong> <strong>photo</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>copy</strong> <em>sourceImage</em>
?<em>option value(s) ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Copies a region from the image called <em>sourceImage</em> (which
must be a photo image) to the image called <em>imageName</em>, possibly
with pixel zooming and/or subsampling. If no options are specified, this
command copies the whole of <em>sourceImage</em> into
<em>imageName</em>, starting at coordinates (0,0) in <em>imageName</em>.
The following options may be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-from</strong> <em>x1 y1 x2 y2</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the source image to be copied.
(<em>x1,y1</em>) and (<em>x2,y2</em>) specify diagonally opposite
corners of the rectangle. If <em>x2</em> and <em>y2</em> are not
specified, the default value is the bottom-right corner of the source
image. The pixels copied will include the left and top edges of the
specified rectangle but not the bottom or right edges. If the
<strong>-from</strong> option is not given, the default is the whole
source image.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-to</strong> <em>x1 y1 x2 y2</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the destination image to be
affected. (<em>x1,y1</em>) and (<em>x2,y2</em>) specify diagonally
opposite corners of the rectangle. If <em>x2</em> and <em>y2</em> are
not specified, the default value is (<em>x1,y1</em>) plus the size of
the source region (after subsampling and zooming, if specified). If
<em>x2</em> and <em>y2</em> are specified, the source region will be
replicated if necessary to fill the destination region in a tiled
fashion.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-shrink</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the size of the destination image should be reduced,
if necessary, so that the region being copied into is at the
bottom-right corner of the image. This option will not affect the width
or height of the image if the user has specified a non-zero value for
the <strong>-width</strong> or <strong>-height</strong> configuration
option, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-zoom</strong> <em>x y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the source region should be magnified by a factor of
<em>x</em> in the X direction and <em>y</em> in the Y direction. If
<em>y</em> is not given, the default value is the same as <em>x</em>.
With this option, each pixel in the source image will be expanded into a
block of <em>x</em> x <em>y</em> pixels in the destination image, all
the same color. <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> must be greater than 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-subsample</strong> <em>x y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the source image should be reduced in size by using
only every <em>x</em>th pixel in the X direction and <em>y</em>th pixel
in the Y direction. Negative values will cause the image to be flipped
about the Y or X axes, respectively. If <em>y</em> is not given, the
default value is the same as <em>x</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-compositingrule</strong> <em>rule</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how transparent pixels in the source image are combined
with the destination image. When a compositing rule of <em>overlay</em>
is set, the old contents of the destination image are visible, as if the
source image were printed on a piece of transparent film and placed over
the top of the destination. When a compositing rule of <em>set</em> is
set, the old contents of the destination image are discarded and the
source image is used as-is. The default compositing rule is
<em>overlay</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>data</strong> ?<em>option value(s)
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns image data in the form of a string. The following options may
be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-background</strong> <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the color is specified, the data will not contain any transparency
information. In all transparent pixels the color will be replaced by the
specified color.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-format</strong> <em>format-name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the image file format handler to be used.
Specifically, this subcommand searches for the first handler whose name
matches an initial substring of <em>format-name</em> and which has the
capability to write a string containing this image data. If this option
is not given, this subcommand uses a format that consists of a list (one
element per row) of lists (one element per pixel/column) of colors in
format (where <em>rr</em> is a pair of hexadecimal digits for the red
channel, <em>gg</em> for green, and <em>bb</em> for blue).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-from</strong> <em>x1 y1 x2 y2</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular region of <em>imageName</em> to be returned.
If only <em>x1</em> and <em>y1</em> are specified, the region extends
from <em>(x1,y1)</em> to the bottom-right corner of <em>imageName</em>.
If all four coordinates are given, they specify diagonally opposite
corners of the rectangular region, including x1,y1 and excluding x2,y2.
The default, if this option is not given, is the whole image.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-grayscale</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this options is specified, the data will not contain color
information. All pixel data will be transformed into grayscale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>get</strong> <em>x y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the color of the pixel at coordinates (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)
in the image as a list of three integers between 0 and 255, representing
the red, green and blue components respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>put</strong> <em>data</em> ?<em>option
value(s) ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets pixels in <em>imageName</em> to the data specified in
<em>data</em>. This command first searches the list of image file format
handlers for a handler that can interpret the data in <em>data</em>, and
then reads the image encoded within into <em>imageName</em> (the
destination image). If <em>data</em> does not match any known format, an
attempt to interpret it as a (top-to-bottom) list of scan-lines is made,
with each scan-line being a (left-to-right) list of pixel colors (see
<strong>Tk_GetColor</strong> for a description of valid colors.) Every
scan-line must be of the same length. Note that when <em>data</em> is a
single color name, you are instructing Tk to fill a rectangular region
with that color. The following options may be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-format</strong> <em>format-name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the format of the image data in <em>data</em>.
Specifically, only image file format handlers whose names begin with
<em>format-name</em> will be used while searching for an image data
format handler to read the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-to</strong> <em>x1 y1</em> ?<em>x2 y2</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the coordinates of the top-left corner
(<em>x1</em>,<em>y1</em>) of the region of <em>imageName</em> into which
the image data will be copied. The default position is (0,0). If
<em>x2</em>,<em>y2</em> is given and <em>data</em> is not large enough
to cover the rectangle specified by this option, the image data
extracted will be tiled so it covers the entire destination rectangle.
Note that if <em>data</em> specifies a single color value, then a region
extending to the bottom-right corner represented by
(<em>x2</em>,<em>y2</em>) will be filled with that color.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>read</strong> <em>filename</em>
?<em>option value(s) ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Reads image data from the file named <em>filename</em> into the
image. This command first searches the list of image file format
handlers for a handler that can interpret the data in <em>filename</em>,
and then reads the image in <em>filename</em> into <em>imageName</em>
(the destination image). The following options may be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-format</strong> <em>format-name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the format of the image data in <em>filename</em>.
Specifically, only image file format handlers whose names begin with
<em>format-name</em> will be used while searching for an image data
format handler to read the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-from</strong> <em>x1 y1 x2 y2</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the image file data to be
copied to the destination image. If only <em>x1</em> and <em>y1</em> are
specified, the region extends from (<em>x1,y1</em>) to the bottom-right
corner of the image in the image file. If all four coordinates are
specified, they specify diagonally opposite corners or the region. The
default, if this option is not specified, is the whole of the image in
the image file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-shrink</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option, the size of <em>imageName</em> will be reduced, if
necessary, so that the region into which the image file data are read is
at the bottom-right corner of the <em>imageName</em>. This option will
not affect the width or height of the image if the user has specified a
non-zero value for the <strong>-width</strong> or
<strong>-height</strong> configuration option, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-to</strong> <em>x y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the coordinates of the top-left corner of the region of
<em>imageName</em> into which data from <em>filename</em> are to be
read. The default is (0,0).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>redither</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The dithering algorithm used in displaying photo images propagates
quantization errors from one pixel to its neighbors. If the image data
for <em>imageName</em> is supplied in pieces, the dithered image may not
be exactly correct. Normally the difference is not noticeable, but if it
is a problem, this command can be used to recalculate the dithered image
in each window where the image is displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>transparency</strong> <em>subcommand</em>
?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows examination and manipulation of the transparency information
in the photo image. Several subcommands are available:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>transparency get</strong> <em>x
y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a boolean indicating if the pixel at (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)
is transparent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>transparency set</strong> <em>x y
boolean</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes the pixel at (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) transparent if
<em>boolean</em> is true, and makes that pixel opaque otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>imageName</em> <strong>write</strong> <em>filename</em>
?<em>option value(s) ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Writes image data from <em>imageName</em> to a file named
<em>filename</em>. The following options may be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-background</strong> <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the color is specified, the data will not contain any transparency
information. In all transparent pixels the color will be replaced by the
specified color.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-format</strong> <em>format-name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the image file format handler to be used to
write the data to the file. Specifically, this subcommand searches for
the first handler whose name matches an initial substring of
<em>format-name</em> and which has the capability to write an image
file. If this option is not given, the format is guessed from the file
extension. If that cannot be determined, this subcommand uses the first
handler that has the capability to write an image file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-from</strong> <em>x1 y1 x2 y2</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a rectangular region of <em>imageName</em> to be written to
the image file. If only <em>x1</em> and <em>y1</em> are specified, the
region extends from <em>(x1,y1)</em> to the bottom-right corner of
<em>imageName</em>. If all four coordinates are given, they specify
diagonally opposite corners of the rectangular region. The default, if
this option is not given, is the whole image.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-grayscale</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this options is specified, the data will not contain color
information. All pixel data will be transformed into grayscale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="image-formats">IMAGE FORMATS</h1>
<p>The photo image code is structured to allow handlers for additional
image file formats to be added easily. The photo image code maintains a
list of these handlers. Handlers are added to the list by registering
them with a call to <strong>Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat</strong>. The
standard Tk distribution comes with handlers for PPM/PGM, PNG and GIF
formats, which are automatically registered on initialization.</p>
<p>When reading an image file or processing string data specified with
the <strong>-data</strong> configuration option, the photo image code
invokes each handler in turn until one is found that claims to be able
to read the data in the file or string. Usually this will find the
correct handler, but if it does not, the user may give a format name
with the <strong>-format</strong> option to specify which handler to
use. In fact the photo image code will try those handlers whose names
begin with the string specified for the <strong>-format</strong> option
(the comparison is case-insensitive). For example, if the user specifies
<strong>-format gif</strong>, then a handler named GIF87 or GIF89 may be
invoked, but a handler named JPEG may not (assuming that such handlers
had been registered).</p>
<p>When writing image data to a file, the processing of the
<strong>-format</strong> option is slightly different: the string value
given for the <strong>-format</strong> option must begin with the
complete name of the requested handler, and may contain additional
information following that, which the handler can use, for example, to
specify which variant to use of the formats supported by the handler.
Note that not all image handlers may support writing transparency data
to a file, even where the target image format does.</p>
<h2 id="format-suboptions">FORMAT SUBOPTIONS</h2>
<p>Some image formats support sub-options, which are specified at the
time that the image is loaded using additional words in the
<strong>-format</strong> option. At the time of writing, the following
are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>gif -index</strong> <em>indexValue</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>When parsing a multi-part GIF image, Tk normally only accesses the
first image. By giving the <strong>-index</strong> sub-option, the
<em>indexValue</em>'th value may be used instead. The
<em>indexValue</em> must be an integer from 0 up to the number of image
parts in the GIF data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>png -alpha</strong> <em>alphaValue</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>An additional alpha filtering for the overall image, which allows the
background on which the image is displayed to show through. This usually
also has the effect of desaturating the image. The <em>alphaValue</em>
must be between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="color-allocation">COLOR ALLOCATION</h1>
<p>When a photo image is displayed in a window, the photo image code
allocates colors to use to display the image and dithers the image, if
necessary, to display a reasonable approximation to the image using the
colors that are available. The colors are allocated as a color cube,
that is, the number of colors allocated is the product of the number of
shades of red, green and blue.</p>
<p>Normally, the number of colors allocated is chosen based on the depth
of the window. For example, in an 8-bit PseudoColor window, the photo
image code will attempt to allocate seven shades of red, seven shades of
green and four shades of blue, for a total of 198 colors. In a 1-bit
StaticGray (monochrome) window, it will allocate two colors, black and
white. In a 24-bit DirectColor or TrueColor window, it will allocate 256
shades each of red, green and blue. Fortunately, because of the way that
pixel values can be combined in DirectColor and TrueColor windows, this
only requires 256 colors to be allocated. If not all of the colors can
be allocated, the photo image code reduces the number of shades of each
primary color and tries again.</p>
<p>The user can exercise some control over the number of colors that a
photo image uses with the <strong>-palette</strong> configuration
option. If this option is used, it specifies the maximum number of
shades of each primary color to try to allocate. It can also be used to
force the image to be displayed in shades of gray, even on a color
display, by giving a single number rather than three numbers separated
by slashes.</p>
<h1 id="credits">CREDITS</h1>
<p>The photo image type was designed and implemented by Paul Mackerras,
based on his earlier photo widget and some suggestions from John
Ousterhout.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Load an image from a file and tile it to the size of a window, which
is useful for producing a tiled background:</p>
<pre><code># These lines should be called once
image create photo untiled -file &quot;theFile.ppm&quot;
image create photo tiled

# These lines should be called whenever .someWidget changes
# size; a &lt;Configure&gt; binding is useful here
set width  [winfo width .someWidget]
set height [winfo height .someWidget]
tiled copy untiled -to 0 0 $width $height -shrink</code></pre>
<p>The PNG image loader allows the application of an additional alpha
factor during loading, which is useful for generating images suitable
for disabled buttons:</p>
<pre><code>image create photo icon -file &quot;icon.png&quot;
image create photo iconDisabled -file &quot;icon.png&quot; \
        -format &quot;png -alpha 0.5&quot;
button .b -image icon -disabledimage iconDisabled</code></pre>
