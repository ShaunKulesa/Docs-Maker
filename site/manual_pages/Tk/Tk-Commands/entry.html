<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>entry</strong> command creates a new window (given by the
<em>pathName</em> argument) and makes it into an entry widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the entry such as
its colors, font, and relief. The <strong>entry</strong> command returns
its <em>pathName</em> argument. At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named <em>pathName</em>, but
<em>pathName</em>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>An entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and allows
that string to be edited using widget commands described below, which
are typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions. When first created,
an entry's string is empty. A portion of the entry may be selected as
described below. If an entry is exporting its selection (see the
<strong>-exportselection</strong> option), then it will observe the
standard X11 protocols for handling the selection; entry selections are
available as type <strong>STRING</strong>. Entries also observe the
standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus. When an entry has
the input focus it displays an <em>insertion cursor</em> to indicate
where new characters will be inserted.</p>
<p>Entries are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit
entirely within the widget's window. In this case, only a portion of the
string will be displayed; commands described below may be used to change
the view in the window. Entries use the standard
<strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> mechanism for interacting with
scrollbars (see the description of the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong>
option for details). They also support scanning, as described below.</p>
<h1 id="validation">VALIDATION</h1>
<p>Validation works by setting the <strong>-validatecommand</strong>
option to a script (<em>validateCommand</em>) which will be evaluated
according to the <strong>-validate</strong> option as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>
<p>Default. This means no validation will occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focus</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry receives or
loses focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusin</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry receives
focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>focusout</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry loses
focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>key</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry is edited.</p>
</dd>
<dt>all</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>validateCommand</em> will be called for all above conditions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the value of the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> and <strong>-invalidcommand</strong>
options, just as you would in a <strong>bind</strong> script. The
following substitutions are recognized:</p>
<dl>
<dt>%d</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of action: 1 for <strong>insert</strong>, 0 for
<strong>delete</strong>, or -1 for focus, forced or textvariable
validation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%i</dt>
<dd>
<p>Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise
-1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%P</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value of the entry if the edit is allowed. If you are configuring
the entry widget to have a new textvariable, this will be the value of
that textvariable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s</dt>
<dd>
<p>The current value of entry prior to editing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%S</dt>
<dd>
<p>The text string being inserted/deleted, if any, {} otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%v</dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of validation currently set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>%V</dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin,
focusout, forced).</p>
</dd>
<dt>%W</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the entry widget.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In general, the <strong>-textvariable</strong> and
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> options can be dangerous to mix. Any
problems have been overcome so that using the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> will not interfere with the
traditional behavior of the entry widget. Using the
<strong>-textvariable</strong> for read-only purposes will never cause
problems. The danger comes when you try set the
<strong>-textvariable</strong> to something that the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> would not accept, which causes
<strong>-validate</strong> to become <em>none</em> (the
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong> will not be triggered). The same
happens when an error occurs evaluating the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong>.</p>
<p>Primarily, an error will occur when the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> or <strong>-invalidcommand</strong>
encounters an error in its script while evaluating or
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> does not return a valid Tcl boolean
value. The <strong>-validate</strong> option will also set itself to
<strong>none</strong> when you edit the entry widget from within either
the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> or the
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong>. Such editions will override the one
that was being validated. If you wish to edit the entry widget (for
example set it to {}) during validation and still have the
<strong>-validate</strong> option set, you should include the
command</p>
<pre><code>after idle {%W config -validate %v}</code></pre>
<p>in the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> or
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong> (whichever one you were editing the
entry widget from). It is also recommended to not set an associated
<strong>-textvariable</strong> during validation, as that can cause the
entry widget to become out of sync with the
<strong>-textvariable</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>entry</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is <em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<pre><code>pathName subcommand ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>Subcommand</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact
behavior of the command.</p>
<h2 id="indices">INDICES</h2>
<p>Many of the widget commands for entries take one or more indices as
arguments. An index specifies a particular character in the entry's
string, in any of the following ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>number</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to
the first character in the string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>anchor</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
<strong>select from</strong> and <strong>select adjust</strong> widget
commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>end</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the entry's
string. This is equivalent to specifying a numerical index equal to the
length of the entry's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>insert</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the
insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sel.first</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the first character in the selection. It is an error to use
this form if the selection is not in the entry window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sel.last</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection. It
is an error to use this form if the selection is not in the entry
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><span class="citation"
data-cites="*">@*</span></strong>number*</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form, <em>number</em> is treated as an x-coordinate in the
entry's window; the character spanning that x-coordinate is used. For
example, indicates the left-most character in the window.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g. or In
general, out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest
legal value.</p>
<h2 id="subcommands">SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<p>The following commands are possible for entry widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>bbox</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
character given by <em>index</em>. The first two elements of the list
give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen area
covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last
two elements give the width and height of the character, in pixels. The
bounding box may refer to a region outside the visible area of the
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>entry</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <em>pathName</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>entry</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>delete</strong> <em>first</em>
?<em>last</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delete one or more elements of the entry. <em>First</em> is the index
of the first character to delete, and <em>last</em> is the index of the
character just after the last one to delete. If <em>last</em> is not
specified it defaults to <em>first</em>+1, i.e. a single character is
deleted. This command returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>get</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the entry's string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>icursor</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the
character given by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>index</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the numerical index corresponding to <em>index</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>insert</strong> <em>index string</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the characters of <em>string</em> just before the character
indicated by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan</strong> <em>option args</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to implement scanning on entries. It has two
forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan mark</strong> <em>x</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Records <em>x</em> and the current view in the entry window; used in
conjunction with later <strong>scan dragto</strong> commands. Typically
this command is associated with a mouse button press in the widget. It
returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan dragto</strong> <em>x</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command computes the difference between its <em>x</em> argument
and the <em>x</em> argument to the last <strong>scan mark</strong>
command for the widget. It then adjusts the view left or right by 10
times the difference in x-coordinates. This command is typically
associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce the effect
of dragging the entry at high speed through the window. The return value
is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection</strong> <em>option
arg</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to adjust the selection within an entry. It has
several forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection adjust</strong>
<em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character given by
<em>index</em>, and adjust that end of the selection to be at
<em>index</em> (i.e. including but not going beyond <em>index</em>). The
other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future
<strong>select to</strong> commands. If the selection is not currently
in the entry, then a new selection is created to include the characters
between <em>index</em> and the most recent selection anchor point,
inclusive. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection clear</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget. If the
selection is not in this widget then the command has no effect. Returns
an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection from</strong>
<em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the selection anchor point to just before the character given by
<em>index</em>. Does not change the selection. Returns an empty
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection present</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the entry, 0 if
nothing is selected.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection range</strong> <em>start</em>
<em>end</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the one
indexed by <em>start</em> and ending with the one just before
<em>end</em>. If <em>end</em> refers to the same character as
<em>start</em> or an earlier one, then the entry's selection is
cleared.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>selection to</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>index</em> is before the anchor point, set the selection to
the characters from <em>index</em> up to but not including the anchor
point. If <em>index</em> is the same as the anchor point, do nothing. If
<em>index</em> is after the anchor point, set the selection to the
characters from the anchor point up to but not including <em>index</em>.
The anchor point is determined by the most recent <strong>select
from</strong> or <strong>select adjust</strong> command in this widget.
If the selection is not in this widget then a new selection is created
using the most recent anchor point specified for the widget. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>validate</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to force an evaluation of the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> independent of the conditions
specified by the <strong>-validate</strong> option. This is done by
temporarily setting the <strong>-validate</strong> option to
<strong>all</strong>. It returns 0 or 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview</strong> <em>args</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
the text in the widget's window. It can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal span
that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2
and the second element is .6, 20% of the entry's text is off-screen to
the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text
is off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to
scrollbars via the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by
<em>index</em> is displayed at the left edge of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview moveto</strong>
<em>fraction</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character
<em>fraction</em> of the way through the text appears at the left edge
of the window. <em>Fraction</em> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>xview scroll</strong> <em>number
what</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to
<em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer.
<em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or
<strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of one of these. If
<em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right
by <em>number</em> average-width characters on the display; if it is
<strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by <em>number</em>
screenfuls. If <em>number</em> is negative then characters farther to
the left become visible; if it is positive then characters farther to
the right become visible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for entries that give them
the following default behavior. In the descriptions below, refers to a
contiguous group of letters, digits, or characters, or any single
character other than these.</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before
the character underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this
widget, and clears any selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse
button 1 strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the
character under the mouse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse
and positions the insertion cursor at the end of the word. Dragging
after a double click will stroke out a selection consisting of whole
words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the
entry and positions the insertion cursor at the end of the line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse
button 1 while the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of the
selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was
pressed. If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the
selection will be adjusted in units of whole words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position the
insertion cursor in the entry without affecting the selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If any normal printing characters are typed in an entry, they are
inserted at the point of the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The view in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with the middle
mouse button (button 2, or button 3 in TkAqua). If the middle mouse
button is clicked without moving the mouse, the selection is copied into
the entry at the position of the mouse cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[8]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the mouse is dragged out of the entry on the left or right sides
while button 1 is pressed, the entry will automatically scroll to make
more text visible (if there is more text off-screen on the side where
the mouse left the window).</p>
</dd>
<dt>[9]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to
the left or right; they also clear any selection in the entry and set
the selection anchor. If Left or Right is typed with the Shift key down,
then the insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include
the new character. Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion
cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the
insertion cursor by words and also extend the selection. Control-b and
Control-f behave the same as Left and Right, respectively. Meta-b and
Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control-Right,
respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[10]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to the
beginning of the entry and clear any selection in the entry. Shift-Home
moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the entry and also
extends the selection to that point.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[11]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the end
of the entry and clear any selection in the entry. Shift-End moves the
cursor to the end and extends the selection to that point.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[12]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the
position of the insertion cursor. They do not affect the current
selection. Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection to
the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor
to the insertion cursor if there was not any selection previously.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[13]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-/ selects all the text in the entry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[14]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-\ clears any selection in the entry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[15]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies
the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a
selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[16]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w
copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the
selection. If there is no selection in the widget then these keys have
no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[17]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations) or Control-y
inserts the contents of the clipboard at the position of the insertion
cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[18]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the entry.
If there is no selection, it deletes the character to the right of the
insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[19]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is one
in the entry. If there is no selection, it deletes the character to the
left of the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[20]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion
cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[21]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[22]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion
cursor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[23]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of
the insertion cursor.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the entry is disabled using the <strong>-state</strong> option,
then the entry's view can still be adjusted and text in the entry can
still be selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no text
modifications will take place except if the entry is linked to a
variable using the <strong>-textvariable</strong> option, in which case
any changes to the variable are reflected by the entry whatever the
value of its <strong>-state</strong> option.</p>
<p>The behavior of entries can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
