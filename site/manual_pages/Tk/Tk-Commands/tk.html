<p>tk - Manipulate Tk internal state</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>tk</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>tk</strong> command provides access to miscellaneous
elements of Tk's internal state. Most of the information manipulated by
this command pertains to the application as a whole, or to a screen or
display, rather than to a particular window. The command can take any of
a number of different forms depending on the <em>option</em> argument.
The legal forms are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>tk appname</strong> ?<em>newName</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>newName</em> is not specified, this command returns the name
of the application (the name that may be used in <strong>send</strong>
commands to communicate with the application). If <em>newName</em> is
specified, then the name of the application is changed to
<em>newName</em>. If the given name is already in use, then a suffix of
the form or is appended in order to make the name unique. The command's
result is the name actually chosen. <em>newName</em> should not start
with a capital letter. This will interfere with option processing, since
names starting with capitals are assumed to be classes; as a result, Tk
may not be able to find some options for the application. If sends have
been disabled by deleting the <strong>send</strong> command, this
command will reenable them and recreate the <strong>send</strong>
command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk busy</strong> <em>subcommand</em> ...</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command controls the marking of window hierarchies as rendering
them non-interactive while some other operation is proceeding. For more
details see the <strong>busy</strong> manual page.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk caret</strong> <em>window</em> ?<strong>-x</strong>
<em>x</em>? ?<strong>-y</strong> <em>y</em>? ?<strong>-height</strong>
<em>height</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets and queries the caret location for the display of the specified
Tk window <em>window</em>. The caret is the per-display cursor location
used for indicating global focus (e.g.Â to comply with Microsoft
Accessibility guidelines), as well as for location of the over-the-spot
XIM (X Input Methods) or Windows IME windows. If no options are
specified, the last values used for setting the caret are return in
option-value pair format. <strong>-x</strong> and <strong>-y</strong>
represent window-relative coordinates, and <strong>-height</strong> is
the height of the current cursor location, or the height of the
specified <em>window</em> if none is given.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk inactive</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<strong>reset</strong>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a positive integer, the number of milliseconds since the last
time the user interacted with the system. If the
<strong>-displayof</strong> option is given then the return value refers
to the display of <em>window</em>; otherwise it refers to the display of
the application's main window.</p>
<p><strong>tk inactive</strong> will return -1, if querying the user
inactive time is not supported by the system, and in safe
interpreters.</p>
<p>If the literal string <strong>reset</strong> is given as an
additional argument, the timer is reset and an empty string is returned.
Resetting the inactivity time is forbidden in safe interpreters and will
throw an error if tried.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk fontchooser</strong> <em>subcommand</em> ...</dt>
<dd>
<p>Controls the Tk font selection dialog. For more details see the
<strong>fontchooser</strong> manual page.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk scaling</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<em>number</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets and queries the current scaling factor used by Tk to convert
between physical units (for example, points, inches, or millimeters) and
pixels. The <em>number</em> argument is a floating point number that
specifies the number of pixels per point on <em>window</em>'s display.
If the <em>window</em> argument is omitted, it defaults to the main
window. If the <em>number</em> argument is omitted, the current value of
the scaling factor is returned.</p>
<p>A is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch. A scaling factor of
1.0 corresponds to 1 pixel per point, which is equivalent to a standard
72 dpi monitor. A scaling factor of 1.25 would mean 1.25 pixels per
point, which is the setting for a 90 dpi monitor; setting the scaling
factor to 1.25 on a 72 dpi monitor would cause everything in the
application to be displayed 1.25 times as large as normal. The initial
value for the scaling factor is set when the application starts, based
on properties of the installed monitor, but it can be changed at any
time. Measurements made after the scaling factor is changed will use the
new scaling factor, but it is undefined whether existing widgets will
resize themselves dynamically to accommodate the new scaling factor.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk useinputmethods</strong> ?<strong>-displayof</strong>
<em>window</em>? ?<em>boolean</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets and queries the state of whether Tk should use XIM (X Input
Methods) for filtering events. The resulting state is returned. XIM is
used in some locales (i.e., Japanese, Korean), to handle special input
devices. This feature is only significant on X. If XIM support is not
available, this will always return 0. If the <em>window</em> argument is
omitted, it defaults to the main window. If the <em>boolean</em>
argument is omitted, the current state is returned. This is turned on by
default for the main display.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tk windowingsystem</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current Tk windowing system, one of <strong>x11</strong>
(X11-based), <strong>win32</strong> (MS Windows), or
<strong>aqua</strong> (Mac OS X Aqua).</p>
</dd>
