<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -direction
Database Name:  direction
Database Class: Direction</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies where the menu is going to be popup up.
<strong>above</strong> tries to pop the menu above the menubutton.
<strong>below</strong> tries to pop the menu below the menubutton.
<strong>left</strong> tries to pop the menu to the left of the
menubutton. <strong>right</strong> tries to pop the menu to the right of
the menu button. <strong>flush</strong> pops the menu directly over the
menubutton. In the case of <strong>above</strong> or
<strong>below</strong>, the direction will be reversed if the menu would
show offscreen.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -height
Database Name:  height
Database Class: Height</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a desired height for the menubutton. If an image or bitmap
is being displayed in the menubutton then the value is in screen units
(i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for
text it is in lines of text. If this option is not specified, the
menubutton's desired height is computed from the size of the image or
bitmap or text being displayed in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -indicatoron
Database Name:  indicatorOn
Database Class: IndicatorOn</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The value must be a proper boolean value. If it is true then a small
indicator rectangle will be displayed on the right side of the
menubutton and the default menu bindings will treat this as an option
menubutton. If false then no indicator will be displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -menu
Database Name:  menu
Database Class: MenuName</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the path name of the menu associated with this menubutton.
The menu must be a child of the menubutton.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -state
Database Name:  state
Database Class: State</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the menubutton:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>, or
<strong>disabled</strong>. In normal state the menubutton is displayed
using the <strong>foreground</strong> and <strong>background</strong>
options. The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the
menubutton. In active state the menubutton is displayed using the
<strong>-activeforeground</strong> and
<strong>-activebackground</strong> options. Disabled state means that
the menubutton should be insensitive: the default bindings will refuse
to activate the widget and will ignore mouse button presses. In this
state the <strong>-disabledforeground</strong> and
<strong>-background</strong> options determine how the button is
displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -width
Database Name:  width
Database Class: Width</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a desired width for the menubutton. If an image or bitmap
is being displayed in the menubutton then the value is in screen units
(i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for
text it is in characters. If this option is not specified, the
menubutton's desired width is computed from the size of the image or
bitmap or text being displayed in it.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>menubutton</strong> command creates a new window (given
by the <em>pathName</em> argument) and makes it into a menubutton
widget. Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the
menubutton such as its colors, font, text, and initial relief. The
<strong>menubutton</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>'s parent must
exist.</p>
<p>A menubutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap, or
image and is associated with a menu widget. If text is displayed, it
must all be in a single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the
screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of the
<strong>-wraplength</strong> option) and one of the characters may
optionally be underlined using the <strong>-underline</strong> option.
In normal usage, pressing mouse button 1 over the menubutton causes the
associated menu to be posted just underneath the menubutton. If the
mouse is moved over the menu before releasing the mouse button, the
button release causes the underlying menu entry to be invoked. When the
button is released, the menu is unposted.</p>
<p>Menubuttons are used to construct a <strong>tk_optionMenu</strong>,
which is the preferred mechanism for allowing a user to select one item
from a list on Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Menubuttons were also typically organized into groups called menu
bars that allow scanning: if the mouse button is pressed over one
menubutton (causing it to post its menu) and the mouse is moved over
another menubutton in the same menu bar without releasing the mouse
button, then the menu of the first menubutton is unposted and the menu
of the new menubutton is posted instead. <em>This use is deprecated</em>
in favor of setting a <strong>menu</strong> directly as a menubar; see
the <strong>toplevel</strong>'s <strong>-menu</strong> option for how to
do that.</p>
<p>There are several interactions between menubuttons and menus; see the
<strong>menu</strong> manual entry for information on various menu
configurations, such as pulldown menus and option menus.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>menubutton</strong> command creates a new Tcl command
whose name is <em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke
various operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<pre><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of
the command. The following commands are possible for menubutton
widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>menubutton</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <em>pathName</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>menubutton</strong> command.</p>

</dl>
<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for menubuttons that give
them the following default behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A menubutton activates whenever the mouse passes over it and
deactivates whenever the mouse leaves it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pressing mouse button 1 over a menubutton posts the menubutton: its
relief changes to raised and its associated menu is posted under the
menubutton. If the mouse is dragged down into the menu with the button
still down, and if the mouse button is then released over an entry in
the menu, the menubutton is unposted and the menu entry is invoked.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If button 1 is pressed over a menubutton and then released over that
menubutton, the menubutton stays posted: you can still move the mouse
over the menu and click button 1 on an entry to invoke it. Once a menu
entry has been invoked, the menubutton unposts itself.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If button 1 is pressed over a menubutton and then dragged over some
other menubutton, the original menubutton unposts itself and the new
menubutton posts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If button 1 is pressed over a menubutton and released outside any
menubutton or menu, the menubutton unposts without invoking any menu
entry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When a menubutton is posted, its associated menu claims the input
focus to allow keyboard traversal of the menu and its submenus. See the
<strong>menu</strong> manual entry for details on these bindings.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the <strong>-underline</strong> option has been specified for a
menubutton then keyboard traversal may be used to post the menubutton:
Alt+<em>x</em>, where <em>x</em> is the underlined character (or its
lower-case or upper-case equivalent), may be typed in any window under
the menubutton's toplevel to post the menubutton.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[8]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The F10 key may be typed in any window to post the first menubutton
under its toplevel window that is not disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[9]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a menubutton has the input focus, the space and return keys post
the menubutton.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the menubutton's state is <strong>disabled</strong> then none of
the above actions occur: the menubutton is completely
non-responsive.</p>
<p>The behavior of menubuttons can be changed by defining new bindings
for individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
