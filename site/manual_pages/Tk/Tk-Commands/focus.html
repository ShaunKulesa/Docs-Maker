<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>focus</strong> command is used to manage the Tk input
focus. At any given time, one window on each display is designated as
the <em>focus window</em>; any key press or key release events for the
display are sent to that window. It is normally up to the window manager
to redirect the focus among the top-level windows of a display. For
example, some window managers automatically set the input focus to a
top-level window whenever the mouse enters it; others redirect the input
focus only when the user clicks on a window. Usually the window manager
will set the focus only to top-level windows, leaving it up to the
application to redirect the focus among the children of the
top-level.</p>
<p>Tk remembers one focus window for each top-level (the most recent
descendant of that top-level to receive the focus); when the window
manager gives the focus to a top-level, Tk automatically redirects it to
the remembered window. Within a top-level Tk uses an <em>explicit</em>
focus model by default. Moving the mouse within a top-level does not
normally change the focus; the focus changes only when a widget decides
explicitly to claim the focus (e.g., because of a button click), or when
the user types a key such as Tab that moves the focus.</p>
<p>The Tcl procedure <strong>tk_focusFollowsMouse</strong> may be
invoked to create an <em>implicit</em> focus model: it reconfigures Tk
so that the focus is set to a window whenever the mouse enters it. The
Tcl procedures <strong>tk_focusNext</strong> and
<strong>tk_focusPrev</strong> implement a focus order among the windows
of a top-level; they are used in the default bindings for Tab and
Shift-Tab, among other things.</p>
<p>The <strong>focus</strong> command can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>focus</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the path name of the focus window on the display containing
the application's main window, or an empty string if no window in this
application has the focus on that display. Note: it is better to specify
the display explicitly using <strong>-displayof</strong> (see below) so
that the code will work in applications using multiple displays.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>focus</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the application currently has the input focus on <em>window</em>'s
display, this command resets the input focus for <em>window</em>'s
display to <em>window</em> and returns an empty string. If the
application does not currently have the input focus on <em>window</em>'s
display, <em>window</em> will be remembered as the focus for its
top-level; the next time the focus arrives at the top-level, Tk will
redirect it to <em>window</em>. If <em>window</em> is an empty string
then the command does nothing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>focus -displayof</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the focus window on the display containing
<em>window</em>. If the focus window for <em>window</em>'s display is
not in this application, the return value is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>focus -force</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the focus of <em>window</em>'s display to <em>window</em>, even
if the application does not currently have the input focus for the
display. This command should be used sparingly, if at all. In normal
usage, an application should not claim the focus for itself; instead, it
should wait for the window manager to give it the focus. If
<em>window</em> is an empty string then the command does nothing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>focus -lastfor</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the most recent window to have the input focus
among all the windows in the same top-level as <em>window</em>. If no
window in that top-level has ever had the input focus, or if the most
recent focus window has been deleted, then the name of the top-level is
returned. The return value is the window that will receive the input
focus the next time the window manager gives the focus to the
top-level.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="quirks">QUIRKS</h1>
<p>When an internal window receives the input focus, Tk does not
actually set the X focus to that window; as far as X is concerned, the
focus will stay on the top-level window containing the window with the
focus. However, Tk generates FocusIn and FocusOut events just as if the
X focus were on the internal window. This approach gets around a number
of problems that would occur if the X focus were actually moved; the
fact that the X focus is on the top-level is invisible unless you use C
code to query the X server directly.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>To make a window that only participates in the focus traversal ring
when a variable is set, add the following bindings to the widgets
<em>before</em> and <em>after</em> it in that focus ring:</p>
<pre><code>button .before -text &quot;Before&quot;
button .middle -text &quot;Middle&quot;
button .after  -text &quot;After&quot;
checkbutton .flag -variable traverseToMiddle -takefocus 0
pack .flag -side left
pack .before .middle .after
bind .before &lt;Tab&gt; {
   if {!$traverseToMiddle} {
      focus .after
      break
   }
}
bind .after &lt;Shift-Tab&gt; {
   if {!$traverseToMiddle} {
      focus .before
      break
   }
}
focus .before</code></pre>
