<p><strong>tkwait window</strong> <em>name</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>tkwait</strong> command waits for one of several things
to happen, then it returns without taking any other actions. The return
value is always an empty string. If the first argument is
<strong>variable</strong> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second
argument is the name of a global variable and the command waits for that
variable to be modified. If the first argument is
<strong>visibility</strong> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second
argument is the name of a window and the <strong>tkwait</strong> command
waits for a change in its visibility state (as indicated by the arrival
of a VisibilityNotify event). This form is typically used to wait for a
newly-created window to appear on the screen before taking some action.
If the first argument is <strong>window</strong> (or any abbreviation of
it) then the second argument is the name of a window and the
<strong>tkwait</strong> command waits for that window to be destroyed.
This form is typically used to wait for a user to finish interacting
with a dialog box before using the result of that interaction.</p>
<p>While the <strong>tkwait</strong> command is waiting it processes
events in the normal fashion, so the application will continue to
respond to user interactions. If an event handler invokes
<strong>tkwait</strong> again, the nested call to
<strong>tkwait</strong> must complete before the outer call can
complete.</p>
