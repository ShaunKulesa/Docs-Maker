<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -command
Database Name:  command
Database Class: Command</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a Tcl command to associate with the button. This command is
typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the button
window.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -default
Database Name:  default
Database Class: Default</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the default ring:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>, or
<strong>disabled</strong>. In active state, the button is drawn with the
platform specific appearance for a default button. In normal state, the
button is drawn with the platform specific appearance for a non-default
button, leaving enough space to draw the default button appearance. The
normal and active states will result in buttons of the same size. In
disabled state, the button is drawn with the non-default button
appearance without leaving space for the default appearance. The
disabled state may result in a smaller button than the active state.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -height
Database Name:  height
Database Class: Height</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a desired height for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units (i.e.
any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>); for text
it is in lines of text. If this option is not specified, the button's
desired height is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text
being displayed in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -overrelief
Database Name:  overRelief
Database Class: OverRelief</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies an alternative relief for the button, to be used when the
mouse cursor is over the widget. This option can be used to make toolbar
buttons, by configuring <strong>-relief flat -overrelief</strong>
raised. If the value of this option is the empty string, then no
alternative relief is used when the mouse cursor is over the button. The
empty string is the default value.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -state
Database Name:  state
Database Class: State</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies one of three states for the button:
<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>, or
<strong>disabled</strong>. In normal state the button is displayed using
the <strong>-foreground</strong> and <strong>-background</strong>
options. The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the
button. In active state the button is displayed using the
<strong>-activeforeground</strong> and
<strong>-activebackground</strong> options. Disabled state means that
the button should be insensitive: the default bindings will refuse to
activate the widget and will ignore mouse button presses. In this state
the <strong>-disabledforeground</strong> and
<strong>-background</strong> options determine how the button is
displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Command-Line Name:   -width
Database Name:  width
Database Class: Width</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image or bitmap is
being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units (i.e.
any of the forms acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetPixels</strong>). For a
text button (no image or with <strong>-compound none</strong>) then the
width specifies how much space in characters to allocate for the text
label. If the width is negative then this specifies a minimum width. If
this option is not specified, the button's desired width is computed
from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>button</strong> command creates a new window (given by
the <em>pathName</em> argument) and makes it into a button widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the button such
as its colors, font, text, and initial relief. The
<strong>button</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em> argument.
At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
<em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A button is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.
If text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it can occupy
multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping
occurs because of the <strong>-wraplength</strong> option) and one of
the characters may optionally be underlined using the
<strong>-underline</strong> option. It can display itself in either of
three different ways, according to the <strong>-state</strong> option;
it can be made to appear raised, sunken, or flat; and it can be made to
flash. When a user invokes the button (by pressing mouse button 1 with
the cursor over the button), then the Tcl command specified in the
<strong>-command</strong> option is invoked.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>button</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is <em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<pre><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of
the command. The following commands are possible for button widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>button</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
<em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <em>pathName</em> (see
<strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this
list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will
be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em>
pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by
the <strong>button</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>flash</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Flash the button. This is accomplished by redisplaying the button
several times, alternating between the configured activebackground and
background colors. At the end of the flash the button is left in the
same normal/active state as when the command was invoked. This command
is ignored if the button's state is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>invoke</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke the Tcl command associated with the button, if there is one.
The return value is the return value from the Tcl command, or an empty
string if there is no command associated with the button. This command
is ignored if the button's state is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for buttons that give them
default behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A button activates whenever the mouse passes over it and deactivates
whenever the mouse leaves the button. Under Windows, this binding is
only active when mouse button 1 has been pressed over the button.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A button's relief is changed to sunken whenever mouse button 1 is
pressed over the button, and the relief is restored to its original
value when button 1 is later released.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If mouse button 1 is pressed over a button and later released over
the button, the button is invoked. However, if the mouse is not over the
button when button 1 is released, then no invocation occurs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>When a button has the input focus, the space key causes the button to
be invoked.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the button's state is <strong>disabled</strong> then none of the
above actions occur: the button is completely non-responsive.</p>
<p>The behavior of buttons can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
<h1 id="platform-notes">PLATFORM NOTES</h1>
<p>On Aqua/Mac OS X, some configuration options are ignored for the
purpose of drawing of the widget because they would otherwise conflict
with platform guidelines. The <strong>configure</strong> and
<strong>cget</strong> subcommands can still manipulate the values, but
do not cause any variation to the look of the widget. The options
affected notably include <strong>-background</strong> and
<strong>-relief</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This is the classic Tk demonstration:</p>
<pre><code>button .b -text &quot;Hello, World!&quot; -command exit
pack .b</code></pre>
<p>This example demonstrates how to handle button accelerators:</p>
<pre><code>button .b1 -text Hello -underline 0
button .b2 -text World -underline 0
bind . &lt;Key-h&gt; {.b1 flash; .b1 invoke}
bind . &lt;Key-w&gt; {.b2 flash; .b2 invoke}
pack .b1 .b2</code></pre>
