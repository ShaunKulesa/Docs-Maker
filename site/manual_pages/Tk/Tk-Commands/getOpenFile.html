<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>tk_getOpenFile, tk_getSaveFile - pop up a dialog box for the user to
select a file to open or save.</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>tk_getOpenFile ?option value ...?
tk_getSaveFile ?option value ...?</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The procedures <strong>tk_getOpenFile</strong> and
<strong>tk_getSaveFile</strong> pop up a dialog box for the user to
select a file to open or save. The <strong>tk_getOpenFile</strong>
command is usually associated with the <strong>Open</strong> command in
the <strong>File</strong> menu. Its purpose is for the user to select an
existing file <em>only</em>. If the user enters a non-existent file, the
dialog box gives the user an error prompt and requires the user to give
an alternative selection. If an application allows the user to create
new files, it should do so by providing a separate <strong>New</strong>
menu command.</p>
<p>The <strong>tk_getSaveFile</strong> command is usually associated
with the <strong>Save</strong> as command in the <strong>File</strong>
menu. If the user enters a file that already exists, the dialog box
prompts the user for confirmation whether the existing file should be
overwritten or not.</p>
<p>The following <em>option-value</em> pairs are possible as command
line arguments to these two commands:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-command</strong> <em>string</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke when the user closes
the dialog after having selected an item. This callback is not called if
the user cancelled the dialog. The actual command consists of
<em>string</em> followed by a space and the value selected by the user
in the dialog. This is only available on Mac OS X.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-confirmoverwrite</strong> <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Configures how the Save dialog reacts when the selected file already
exists, and saving would overwrite it. A true value requests a
confirmation dialog be presented to the user. A false value requests
that the overwrite take place without confirmation. Default value is
true.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-defaultextension</strong> <em>extension</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a string that will be appended to the filename if the user
enters a filename without an extension. The default value is the empty
string, which means no extension will be appended to the filename in any
case. This option is ignored on Mac OS X, which does not require
extensions to filenames, and the UNIX implementation guesses reasonable
values for this from the <strong>-filetypes</strong> option when this is
not supplied.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-filetypes</strong> <em>filePatternList</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If a <strong>File types</strong> listbox exists in the file dialog on
the particular platform, this option gives the <em>filetype</em>s in
this listbox. When the user choose a filetype in the listbox, only the
files of that type are listed. If this option is unspecified, or if it
is set to the empty list, or if the <strong>File types</strong> listbox
is not supported by the particular platform then all files are listed
regardless of their types. See the section <strong>SPECIFYING FILE
PATTERNS</strong> below for a discussion on the contents of
<em>filePatternList</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-initialdir</strong> <em>directory</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the files in <em>directory</em> should be displayed
when the dialog pops up. If this parameter is not specified, the initial
directory defaults to the current working directory on non-Windows
systems and on Windows systems prior to Vista. On Vista and later
systems, the initial directory defaults to the last user-selected
directory for the application. If the parameter specifies a relative
path, the return value will convert the relative path to an absolute
path.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-initialfile</strong> <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a filename to be displayed in the dialog when it pops
up.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-message</strong> <em>string</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a message to include in the client area of the dialog. This
is only available on Mac OS X.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-multiple</strong> <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows the user to choose multiple files from the Open dialog.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-parent</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes <em>window</em> the logical parent of the file dialog. The file
dialog is displayed on top of its parent window. On Mac OS X, this turns
the file dialog into a sheet attached to the parent window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-title</strong> <em>titleString</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this
option is not specified, then a default title is displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-typevariable</strong> <em>variableName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The global variable <em>variableName</em> is used to preselect which
filter is used from <em>filterList</em> when the dialog box is opened
and is updated when the dialog box is closed, to the last selected
filter. The variable is read once at the beginning to select the
appropriate filter. If the variable does not exist, or its value does
not match any filter typename, or is empty (<strong>{}</strong>), the
dialog box will revert to the default behavior of selecting the first
filter in the list. If the dialog is canceled, the variable is not
modified.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the user selects a file, both <strong>tk_getOpenFile</strong> and
<strong>tk_getSaveFile</strong> return the full pathname of this file.
If the user cancels the operation, both commands return the empty
string.</p>
<h1 id="specifying-file-patterns">SPECIFYING FILE PATTERNS</h1>
<p>The <em>filePatternList</em> value given by the
<strong>-filetypes</strong> option is a list of file patterns. Each file
pattern is a list of the form</p>
<pre><code>typeName {extension ?extension ...?} ?{macType ?macType ...?}?</code></pre>
<p><em>typeName</em> is the name of the file type described by this file
pattern and is the text string that appears in the <strong>File
types</strong> listbox. <em>extension</em> is a file extension for this
file pattern. <em>macType</em> is a four-character Macintosh file type.
The list of <em>macType</em>s is optional and may be omitted for
applications that do not need to execute on the Macintosh platform.</p>
<p>Several file patterns may have the same <em>typeName,</em> in which
case they refer to the same file type and share the same entry in the
listbox. When the user selects an entry in the listbox, all the files
that match at least one of the file patterns corresponding to that entry
are listed. Usually, each file pattern corresponds to a distinct type of
file. The use of more than one file pattern for one type of file is only
necessary on the Macintosh platform.</p>
<p>On the Macintosh platform, a file matches a file pattern if its name
matches at least one of the <em>extension</em>(s) AND it belongs to at
least one of the <em>macType</em>(s) of the file pattern. For example,
the <strong>C Source Files</strong> file pattern in the sample code
matches with files that have a <strong>.c</strong> extension AND belong
to the <em>macType</em> <strong>TEXT</strong>. To use the OR rule
instead, you can use two file patterns, one with the <em>extensions</em>
only and the other with the <em>macType</em> only. The <strong>GIF
Files</strong> file type in the sample code matches files that
<em>either</em> have a <strong>.gif</strong> extension OR belong to the
<em>macType</em> <strong>GIFF</strong>.</p>
<p>On the Unix and Windows platforms, a file matches a file pattern if
its name matches at least one of the <em>extension</em>(s) of the file
pattern. The <em>macType</em>s are ignored.</p>
<h1 id="specifying-extensions">SPECIFYING EXTENSIONS</h1>
<p>On the Unix and Macintosh platforms, extensions are matched using
glob-style pattern matching. On the Windows platform, extensions are
matched by the underlying operating system. The types of possible
extensions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the special extension matches any file;</p></li>
<li><p>the special extension matches any files that do not have an
extension (i.e., the filename contains no full stop character);</p></li>
<li><p>any character string that does not contain any wild card
characters (* and ?).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the different pattern matching rules on the various platforms,
to ensure portability, wild card characters are not allowed in the
extensions, except as in the special extension Extensions without a full
stop character (e.g.Â are allowed but may not work on all platforms.</p>
