<p>lower - Change a window's position in the stacking order</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>lower</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>belowThis</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>If the <em>belowThis</em> argument is omitted then the command lowers
<em>window</em> so that it is below all of its siblings in the stacking
order (it will be obscured by any siblings that overlap it and will not
obscure any siblings). If <em>belowThis</em> is specified then it must
be the path name of a window that is either a sibling of <em>window</em>
or the descendant of a sibling of <em>window</em>. In this case the
<strong>lower</strong> command will insert <em>window</em> into the
stacking order just below <em>belowThis</em> (or the ancestor of
<em>belowThis</em> that is a sibling of <em>window</em>); this could end
up either raising or lowering <em>window</em>.</p>
<p>All <strong>toplevel</strong> windows may be restacked with respect
to each other, whatever their relative path names, but the window
manager is not obligated to strictly honor requests to restack.</p>
