<p>safe::loadTk - Load Tk into a safe interpreter.</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>safe::loadTk</strong> <em>child</em> ?<strong>-use</strong>
<em>windowId</em>? ?<strong>-display</strong> <em>displayName</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Safe Tk is based on Safe Tcl, which provides a mechanism that allows
restricted and mediated access to auto-loading and packages for safe
interpreters. Safe Tk adds the ability to configure the interpreter for
safe Tk operations and load Tk into safe interpreters.</p>
<p>The <strong>safe::loadTk</strong> command initializes the required
data structures in the named safe interpreter and then loads Tk into it.
The interpreter must have been created with
<strong>safe::interpCreate</strong> or have been initialized with
<strong>safe::interpInit</strong>. The command returns the name of the
safe interpreter. If <strong>-use</strong> is specified, the window
identified by the specified system dependent identifier
<em>windowId</em> is used to contain the window of the safe interpreter;
it can be any valid id, eventually referencing a window belonging to
another application. As a convenience, if the window you plan to use is
a Tk Window of the application you can use the window name (e.g.,
instead of its window Id (e.g., from <strong>winfo id</strong>
<strong>.x.y</strong>). When <strong>-use</strong> is not specified, a
new toplevel window is created for the window of the safe interpreter.
On X11 if you want the embedded window to use another display than the
default one, specify it with <strong>-display</strong>. See the
<strong>SECURITY ISSUES</strong> section below for implementation
details.</p>
<h1 id="security-issues">SECURITY ISSUES</h1>
<p>Please read the <strong>safe</strong> manual page for Tcl to learn
about the basic security considerations for Safe Tcl.</p>
<p><strong>safe::loadTk</strong> adds the value of
<strong>tk_library</strong> taken from the parent interpreter to the
virtual access path of the safe interpreter so that auto-loading will
work in the safe interpreter.</p>
<p>Tk initialization is now safe with respect to not trusting the
child's state for startup. <strong>safe::loadTk</strong> registers the
child's name so when the Tk initialization
(<strong>Tk_SafeInit</strong>) is called and in turn calls the parent's
<strong>safe::InitTk</strong> it will return the desired
<strong>argv</strong> equivalent (<strong>-use</strong>
<em>windowId</em>, correct <strong>-display</strong>, etc.)</p>
<p>When <strong>-use</strong> is not used, the new toplevel created is
specially decorated so the user is always aware that the user interface
presented comes from a potentially unsafe code and can easily delete the
corresponding interpreter.</p>
<p>On X11, conflicting <strong>-use</strong> and
<strong>-display</strong> are likely to generate a fatal X error.</p>
