<p>grab - Confine pointer and keyboard events to a window sub-tree</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>grab</strong> ?<strong>-global</strong>? <em>window</em></p>
<p><strong>grab</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg</em> ...?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command implements simple pointer and keyboard grabs for Tk.
Tk's grabs are different than the grabs described in the Xlib
documentation. When a grab is set for a particular window, Tk restricts
all pointer events to the grab window and its descendants in Tk's window
hierarchy. Whenever the pointer is within the grab window's subtree, the
pointer will behave exactly the same as if there had been no grab at all
and all events will be reported in the normal fashion. When the pointer
is outside <em>window</em>'s tree, button presses and releases and mouse
motion events are reported to <em>window</em>, and window entry and
window exit events are ignored. The grab subtree the pointer: windows
outside the grab subtree will be visible on the screen but they will be
insensitive until the grab is released. The tree of windows underneath
the grab window can include top-level windows, in which case all of
those top-level windows and their descendants will continue to receive
mouse events during the grab.</p>
<p>Two forms of grabs are possible: local and global. A local grab
affects only the grabbing application: events will be reported to other
applications as if the grab had never occurred. Grabs are local by
default. A global grab locks out all applications on the screen, so that
only the given subtree of the grabbing application will be sensitive to
pointer events (mouse button presses, mouse button releases, pointer
motions, window entries, and window exits). During global grabs the
window manager will not receive pointer events either.</p>
<p>During local grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key releases)
are delivered as usual: the window manager controls which application
receives keyboard events, and if they are sent to any window in the
grabbing application then they are redirected to the focus window.
During a global grab Tk grabs the keyboard so that all keyboard events
are always sent to the grabbing application. The <strong>focus</strong>
command is still used to determine which window in the application
receives the keyboard events. The keyboard grab is released when the
grab is released.</p>
<p>On macOS a global grab affects all windows created by one Tk process.
No window in that process other than the grab window can even be
focused, hence no other window receives key or mouse events. A local
grab on macOS affects all windows created by one Tcl interpreter. It is
possible to focus any window belonging to the Tk process during a local
grab but the grab window is the only window created by its interpreter
which receives key or mouse events. Windows belonging to the same
process but created by different interpreters continue to receive key
and mouse events normally.</p>
<p>Grabs apply to particular displays. If an application has windows on
multiple displays then it can establish a separate grab on each display.
The grab on a particular display affects only the windows on that
display. It is possible for different applications on a single display
to have simultaneous local grabs, but only one application can have a
global grab on a given display at once.</p>
<p>The <strong>grab</strong> command can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>grab</strong> ?<strong>-global</strong>?
<em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as <strong>grab set</strong>, described below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>grab current</strong> ?<em>window</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>window</em> is specified, returns the name of the current grab
window in this application for <em>window</em>'s display, or an empty
string if there is no such window. If <em>window</em> is omitted, the
command returns a list whose elements are all of the windows grabbed by
this application for all displays, or an empty string if the application
has no grabs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>grab release</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Releases the grab on <em>window</em> if there is one, otherwise does
nothing. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>grab set</strong> ?<strong>-global</strong>?
<em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets a grab on <em>window</em>. If <strong>-global</strong> is
specified then the grab is global, otherwise it is local. If a grab was
already in effect for this application on <em>window</em>'s display then
it is automatically released. If there is already a grab on
<em>window</em> and it has the same global/local form as the requested
grab, then the command does nothing. Returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>grab status</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>none</strong> if no grab is currently set on
<em>window</em>, <strong>local</strong> if a local grab is set on
<em>window</em>, and <strong>global</strong> if a global grab is
set.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="warning">WARNING</h1>
<p>It is very easy to use global grabs to render a display completely
unusable (e.g.Â by setting a grab on a widget which does not respond to
events and not providing any mechanism for releasing the grab). Take
<em>extreme</em> care when using them!</p>
<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>It took an incredibly complex and gross implementation to produce the
simple grab effect described above. Given the current implementation, it
is not safe for applications to use the Xlib grab facilities at all
except through the Tk grab procedures. If applications try to manipulate
X's grab mechanisms directly, things will probably break.</p>
<p>If a single process is managing several different Tk applications,
only one of those applications can have a local grab for a given display
at any given time. If the applications are in different processes, this
restriction does not exist.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Set a grab so that only one button may be clicked out of a group. The
other buttons are unresponsive to the mouse until the middle button is
clicked.</p>
<pre><code>pack [button .b1 -text &quot;Click me! #1&quot; -command {destroy .b1}]
pack [button .b2 -text &quot;Click me! #2&quot; -command {destroy .b2}]
pack [button .b3 -text &quot;Click me! #3&quot; -command {destroy .b3}]
grab .b2</code></pre>
