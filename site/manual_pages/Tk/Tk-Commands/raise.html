<p>raise - Change a window's position in the stacking order</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>raise</strong> <em>window</em> ?<em>aboveThis</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>If the <em>aboveThis</em> argument is omitted then the command raises
<em>window</em> so that it is above all of its siblings in the stacking
order (it will not be obscured by any siblings and will obscure any
siblings that overlap it). If <em>aboveThis</em> is specified then it
must be the path name of a window that is either a sibling of
<em>window</em> or the descendant of a sibling of <em>window</em>. In
this case the <strong>raise</strong> command will insert <em>window</em>
into the stacking order just above <em>aboveThis</em> (or the ancestor
of <em>aboveThis</em> that is a sibling of <em>window</em>); this could
end up either raising or lowering <em>window</em>.</p>
<p>All <strong>toplevel</strong> windows may be restacked with respect
to each other, whatever their relative path names, but the window
manager is not obligated to strictly honor requests to restack.</p>
<p>On macOS raising an iconified <strong>toplevel</strong> window causes
it to be deiconified.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Make a button appear to be in a sibling frame that was created after
it. This is is often necessary when building GUIs in the style where you
create your activity widgets first before laying them out on the
display:</p>
<pre><code>button .b -text &quot;Hi there!&quot;
pack [frame .f -background blue]
pack [label .f.l1 -text &quot;This is above&quot;]
pack .b -in .f
pack [label .f.l2 -text &quot;This is below&quot;]
raise .b</code></pre>
