<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>option</strong> command allows you to add entries to the
Tk option database or to retrieve options from the database. The
<strong>add</strong> form of the command adds a new option to the
database. <em>Pattern</em> contains the option being specified, and
consists of names and/or classes separated by asterisks or dots, in the
usual X format (see <strong>PATTERN FORMAT</strong>). <em>Value</em>
contains a text string to associate with <em>pattern</em>; this is the
value that will be returned in calls to <strong>Tk_GetOption</strong> or
by invocations of the <strong>option get</strong> command. If
<em>priority</em> is specified, it indicates the priority level for this
option (see below for legal values); it defaults to
<strong>interactive</strong>. This command always returns an empty
string.</p>
<p>The <strong>option clear</strong> command clears the option database.
Default options (from the <strong>RESOURCE_MANAGER</strong> property or
the <strong>.Xdefaults</strong> file) will be reloaded automatically the
next time an option is added to the database or removed from it. This
command always returns an empty string.</p>
<p>The <strong>option get</strong> command returns the value of the
option specified for <em>window</em> under <em>name</em> and
<em>class</em>. If several entries in the option database match
<em>window</em>, <em>name</em>, and <em>class</em>, then the command
returns whichever was created with highest <em>priority</em> level. If
there are several matching entries at the same priority level, then it
returns whichever entry was most recently entered into the option
database. If there are no matching entries, then the empty string is
returned.</p>
<p>The <strong>readfile</strong> form of the command reads
<em>fileName</em>, which should have the standard format for an X
resource database such as <strong>.Xdefaults</strong>, and adds all the
options specified in that file to the option database. If
<em>priority</em> is specified, it indicates the priority level at which
to enter the options; <em>priority</em> defaults to
<strong>interactive</strong>.</p>
<p>The file is read through a channel which is in "utf-8" encoding,
invalid byte sequences are automatically converted to valid ones. This
means that encodings like ISO 8859-1 or cp1252 with high probability
will work as well, but this cannot be guaranteed. This cannot be
changed, setting the [encoding system] has no effect.</p>
<p>The <em>priority</em> arguments to the <strong>option</strong>
command are normally specified symbolically using one of the following
values:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>widgetDefault</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 20. Used for default values hard-coded into widgets.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>startupFile</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 40. Used for options specified in application-specific startup
files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>userDefault</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 60. Used for options specified in user-specific defaults files,
such as <strong>.Xdefaults</strong>, resource databases loaded into the
X server, or user-specific startup files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>interactive</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Level 80. Used for options specified interactively after the
application starts running. If <em>priority</em> is not specified, it
defaults to this level.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any of the above keywords may be abbreviated. In addition, priorities
may be specified numerically using integers between 0 and 100,
inclusive. The numeric form is probably a bad idea except for new
priority levels other than the ones given above.</p>
<h1 id="pattern-format">PATTERN FORMAT</h1>
<p>Patterns consist of a sequence of words separated by either periods,
or asterisks The overall pattern may also be optionally preceded by an
asterisk.</p>
<p>Each word in the pattern conventionally starts with either an
upper-case letter (in which case it denotes the class of either a widget
or an option) or any other character, when it denotes the name of a
widget or option. The last word in the pattern always indicates the
option; the preceding ones constrain which widgets that option will be
looked for in.</p>
<p>When two words are separated by a period, the latter widget must be a
direct child of the former (or the option must apply to only the
indicated widgets). When two words are separated by an asterisk, any
depth of widgets may lie between the former and latter widgets (and the
option applies to all widgets that are children of the former
widget).</p>
<p>If the overall pattern is preceded by an asterisk, then the overall
pattern applies anywhere it can throughout the whole widget hierarchy.
Otherwise the first word of the pattern is matched against the name and
class of the <strong>toplevel</strong>, which are usually set by options
to <strong>wish</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Instruct every button in the application to have red text on it
unless explicitly overridden, by setting the <strong>foreground</strong>
for the <strong>Button</strong> class (note that on some platforms the
option is ignored):</p>
<pre><code>option add *Button.foreground red startupFile</code></pre>
<p>Allow users to control what happens in an entry widget when the
Return key is pressed by specifying a script in the option database and
add a default option for that which rings the bell:</p>
<pre><code>entry .e
bind .e &lt;Return&gt; [option get .e returnCommand Command]
option add *.e.returnCommand bell widgetDefault</code></pre>
