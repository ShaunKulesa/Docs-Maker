<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Token for window in which the graphics context will be used.</p>
<p>Mask of bits (such as <strong>GCForeground</strong> or
<strong>GCStipple</strong>) indicating which fields of
<em>*valuePtr</em> are valid.</p>
<p>Pointer to structure describing the desired values for the graphics
context.</p>
<p>Display for which <em>gc</em> was allocated.</p>
<p>X identifier for graphics context that is no longer needed. Must have
been allocated by <strong>Tk_GetGC</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_GetGC</strong> and <strong>Tk_FreeGC</strong> manage a
collection of graphics contexts being used by an application. The
procedures allow graphics contexts to be shared, thereby avoiding the
server overhead that would be incurred if a separate GC were created for
each use. <strong>Tk_GetGC</strong> takes arguments describing the
desired graphics context and returns an X identifier for a GC that fits
the description. The graphics context that is returned will have default
values in all of the fields not specified explicitly by
<em>valueMask</em> and <em>valuePtr</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_GetGC</strong> maintains a database of all the graphics
contexts it has created. Whenever possible, a call to
<strong>Tk_GetGC</strong> will return an existing graphics context
rather than creating a new one. This approach can substantially reduce
server overhead, so <strong>Tk_GetGC</strong> should generally be used
in preference to the Xlib procedure <strong>XCreateGC</strong>, which
creates a new graphics context on each call.</p>
<p>Since the return values of <strong>Tk_GetGC</strong> are shared,
callers should never modify the graphics contexts returned by
<strong>Tk_GetGC</strong>. If a graphics context must be modified
dynamically, then it should be created by calling
<strong>XCreateGC</strong> instead of <strong>Tk_GetGC</strong>.</p>
<p>When a graphics context is no longer needed,
<strong>Tk_FreeGC</strong> should be called to release it. There should
be exactly one call to <strong>Tk_FreeGC</strong> for each call to
<strong>Tk_GetGC</strong>. When a graphics context is no longer in use
anywhere (i.e.Â it has been freed as many times as it has been gotten)
<strong>Tk_FreeGC</strong> will release it to the X server and delete it
from the database.</p>
