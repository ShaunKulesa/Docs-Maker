<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_SetClass</strong> is called to associate a class with a
particular window. The <em>class</em> string identifies the type of the
window; all windows with the same general class of behavior (button,
menu, etc.) should have the same class. By convention all class names
start with a capital letter, and there exists a Tcl command with the
same name as each class (except all in lower-case) which can be used to
create and manipulate windows of that class. A window's class string is
initialized to NULL when the window is created.</p>
<p>For main windows, Tk automatically propagates the name and class to
the WM_CLASS property used by window managers. This happens either when
a main window is actually created (e.g.Â in
<strong>Tk_MakeWindowExist</strong>), or when
<strong>Tk_SetClass</strong> is called, whichever occurs later. If a
main window has not been assigned a class then Tk will not set the
WM_CLASS property for the window.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_Class</strong> is a macro that returns the current value
of <em>tkwin</em>'s class. The value is returned as a Tk_Uid, which may
be used just like a string pointer but also has the properties of a
unique identifier (see the manual entry for <strong>Tk_GetUid</strong>
for details). If <em>tkwin</em> has not yet been given a class, then
<strong>Tk_Class</strong> will return NULL.</p>
