<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Each window managed by Tk has two names, a short name that identifies
a window among children of the same parent, and a path name that
identifies the window uniquely among all the windows belonging to the
same main window. The path name is used more often in Tk than the short
name; many commands, like <strong>bind</strong>, expect path names as
arguments.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tk_Name</strong> macro returns a window's short name,
which is the same as the <em>name</em> argument passed to
<strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong> when the window was created. The value
is returned as a Tk_Uid, which may be used just like a string pointer
but also has the properties of a unique identifier (see the manual entry
for <strong>Tk_GetUid</strong> for details).</p>
<p>The <strong>Tk_PathName</strong> macro returns a hierarchical name
for <em>tkwin</em>. Path names have a structure similar to file names in
Unix but with dots between elements instead of slashes: the main window
for an application has the path name its children have names like and
their children have names like and and so on. A window is considered to
be a child of another window for naming purposes if the second window
was named as the first window's <em>parent</em> when the first window
was created. This is not always the same as the X window hierarchy. For
example, a pop-up is created as a child of the root window, but its
logical parent will usually be a window within the application.</p>
<p>The procedure <strong>Tk_NameToWindow</strong> returns the token for
a window given its path name (the <em>pathName</em> argument) and
another window belonging to the same main window (<em>tkwin</em>). It
normally returns a token for the named window, but if no such window
exists <strong>Tk_NameToWindow</strong> leaves an error message in
interpreter <em>interp</em>'s result and returns NULL. The
<em>tkwin</em> argument to <strong>Tk_NameToWindow</strong> is needed
because path names are only unique within a single application
hierarchy. If, for example, a single process has opened two main
windows, each will have a separate naming hierarchy and the same path
name might appear in each of the hierarchies. Normally <em>tkwin</em> is
the main window of the desired hierarchy, but this need not be the case:
any window in the desired hierarchy may be used.</p>
