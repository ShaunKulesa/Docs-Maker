<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> processes an array of command-line
arguments according to a table describing the kinds of arguments that
are expected. Each of the arguments in <em>argv</em> is processed in
turn: if it matches one of the entries in <em>argTable</em>, the
argument is processed according to that entry and discarded. The
arguments that do not match anything in <em>argTable</em> are copied
down to the beginning of <em>argv</em> (retaining their original order)
and returned to the caller. At the end of the call
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> sets <em>*argcPtr</em> to hold the number
of arguments that are left in <em>argv</em>, and <em>argv[*argcPtr]</em>
will hold the value NULL. Normally, <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong>
assumes that <em>argv[0]</em> is a command name, so it is treated like
an argument that does not match <em>argTable</em> and returned to the
caller; however, if the <strong>TK_ARGV_DONT_SKIP_FIRST_ARG</strong> bit
is set in <em>flags</em> then <em>argv[0]</em> will be processed just
like the other elements of <em>argv</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> normally returns the value
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>. If an error occurs while parsing the arguments,
then <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> will leave an error message in the result
of interpreter <em>interp</em> in the standard Tcl fashion. In the event
of an error return, <em>*argvPtr</em> will not have been modified, but
<em>argv</em> could have been partially modified. The possible causes of
errors are explained below.</p>
<p>The <em>argTable</em> array specifies the kinds of arguments that are
expected; each of its entries has the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
    const char *key;
    int type;
    char *src;
    char *dst;
    const char *help;
} Tk_ArgvInfo;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>key</em> field is a string such as or that is compared with
the values in <em>argv</em>. <em>Type</em> indicates how to process an
argument that matches <em>key</em> (more on this below). <em>Src</em>
and <em>dst</em> are additional values used in processing the argument.
Their exact usage depends on <em>type</em>, but typically <em>src</em>
indicates a value and <em>dst</em> indicates where to store the value.
The <strong>char *</strong> declarations for <em>src</em> and
<em>dst</em> are placeholders: the actual types may be different.
Lastly, <em>help</em> is a string giving a brief description of this
option; this string is printed when users ask for help about
command-line options.</p>
<p>When processing an argument in <em>argv</em>,
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> compares the argument to each of the
<em>key</em>'s in <em>argTable</em>. <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong>
selects the first specifier whose <em>key</em> matches the argument
exactly, if such a specifier exists. Otherwise
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> selects a specifier for which the argument
is a unique abbreviation. If the argument is a unique abbreviation for
more than one specifier, then an error is returned. If there is no
matching entry in <em>argTable</em>, then the argument is skipped and
returned to the caller.</p>
<p>Once a matching argument specifier is found,
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> processes the argument according to the
<em>type</em> field of the specifier. The argument that matched
<em>key</em> is called in the descriptions below. As part of the
processing, <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> may also use the next argument
in <em>argv</em> after the matching argument, which is called The legal
values for <em>type</em>, and the processing that they cause, are as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_END</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the end of the table. The last entry in <em>argTable</em> must
have this type; all of its other fields are ignored and it will never
match any arguments.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_CONSTANT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Src</em> is treated as an integer and <em>dst</em> is treated as
a pointer to an integer. <em>Src</em> is stored at <em>*dst</em>. The
matching argument is discarded.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_INT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The following argument must contain an integer string in the format
accepted by <strong>strtol</strong> (e.g.Â and prefixes may be used to
specify octal or hexadecimal numbers, respectively). <em>Dst</em> is
treated as a pointer to an integer; the following argument is converted
to an integer value and stored at <em>*dst</em>. <em>Src</em> is
ignored. The matching and following arguments are discarded from
<em>argv</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_FLOAT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The following argument must contain a floating-point number in the
format accepted by <strong>strtol</strong>. <em>Dst</em> is treated as
the address of a double-precision floating point value; the following
argument is converted to a double-precision value and stored at
<em>*dst</em>. The matching and following arguments are discarded from
<em>argv</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_STRING</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form, <em>dst</em> is treated as a pointer to a (char *);
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> stores at <em>*dst</em> a pointer to the
following argument, and discards the matching and following arguments
from <em>argv</em>. <em>Src</em> is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_UID</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This form is similar to <strong>TK_ARGV_STRING</strong>, except that
the argument is turned into a Tk_Uid by calling
<strong>Tk_GetUid</strong>. <em>Dst</em> is treated as a pointer to a
Tk_Uid; <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> stores at <em>*dst</em> the Tk_Uid
corresponding to the following argument, and discards the matching and
following arguments from <em>argv</em>. <em>Src</em> is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_CONST_OPTION</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This form causes a Tk option to be set (as if the
<strong>option</strong> command had been invoked). The <em>src</em>
field is treated as a pointer to a string giving the value of an option,
and <em>dst</em> is treated as a pointer to the name of the option. The
matching argument is discarded. If <em>tkwin</em> is NULL, then argument
specifiers of this type are ignored (as if they did not exist).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_OPTION_VALUE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This form is similar to <strong>TK_ARGV_CONST_OPTION</strong>, except
that the value of the option is taken from the following argument
instead of from <em>src</em>. <em>Dst</em> is used as the name of the
option. <em>Src</em> is ignored. The matching and following arguments
are discarded. If <em>tkwin</em> is NULL, then argument specifiers of
this type are ignored (as if they did not exist).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_OPTION_NAME_VALUE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this case the following argument is taken as the name of a Tk
option and the argument after that is taken as the value for that
option. Both <em>src</em> and <em>dst</em> are ignored. All three
arguments are discarded from <em>argv</em>. If <em>tkwin</em> is NULL,
then argument specifiers of this type are ignored (as if they did not
exist).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_HELP</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When this kind of option is encountered,
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> uses the <em>help</em> fields of
<em>argTable</em> to format a message describing all the valid
arguments. The message is placed in interpreter <em>interp</em>'s result
and <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> returns <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>.
When this happens, the caller normally prints the help message and
aborts. If the <em>key</em> field of a <strong>TK_ARGV_HELP</strong>
specifier is NULL, then the specifier will never match any arguments; in
this case the specifier simply provides extra documentation, which will
be included when some other <strong>TK_ARGV_HELP</strong> entry causes
help information to be returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_REST</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used by programs or commands that allow the last
several of their options to be the name and/or options for some other
program. If a <strong>TK_ARGV_REST</strong> argument is found, then
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> does not process any of the remaining
arguments; it returns them all at the beginning of <em>argv</em> (along
with any other unprocessed arguments). In addition,
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> treats <em>dst</em> as the address of an
integer value, and stores at <em>*dst</em> the index of the first of the
<strong>TK_ARGV_REST</strong> options in the returned <em>argv</em>.
This allows the program to distinguish the <strong>TK_ARGV_REST</strong>
options from other unprocessed options that preceded the
<strong>TK_ARGV_REST</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_FUNC</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>For this kind of argument, <em>src</em> is treated as the address of
a procedure, which is invoked to process the following argument. The
procedure should have the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>int
func(dst, key, nextArg)
    char *dst;
    char *key;
    char *nextArg;
{
}</code></pre>
<p>The <em>dst</em> and <em>key</em> parameters will contain the
corresponding fields from the <em>argTable</em> entry, and
<em>nextArg</em> will point to the following argument from <em>argv</em>
(or NULL if there are not any more arguments left in <em>argv</em>). If
<em>func</em> uses <em>nextArg</em> (so that
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> should discard it), then it should return
1. Otherwise it should return 0 and <strong>TkParseArgv</strong> will
process the following argument in the normal fashion. In either event
the matching argument is discarded.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_GENFUNC</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This form provides a more general procedural escape. It treats
<em>src</em> as the address of a procedure, and passes that procedure
all of the remaining arguments. The procedure should have the following
form:</p>
<pre><code>int
genfunc(dst, interp, key, argc, argv)
    char *dst;
    Tcl_Interp *interp;
    char *key;
    int argc;
    char **argv;
{
}</code></pre>
<p>The <em>dst</em> and <em>key</em> parameters will contain the
corresponding fields from the <em>argTable</em> entry. <em>Interp</em>
will be the same as the <em>interp</em> argument to
<strong>Tcl_ParseArgv</strong>. <em>Argc</em> and <em>argv</em> refer to
all of the options after the matching one. <em>Genfunc</em> should
behave in a fashion similar to <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong>: parse as
many of the remaining arguments as it can, then return any that are left
by compacting them to the beginning of <em>argv</em> (starting at
<em>argv</em>[0]). <em>Genfunc</em> should return a count of how many
arguments are left in <em>argv</em>; <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> will
process them. If <em>genfunc</em> encounters an error then it should
leave an error message in interpreter <em>interp</em>'s result, in the
usual Tcl fashion, and return -1; when this happens
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> will abort its processing and return
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="flags">FLAGS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_DONT_SKIP_FIRST_ARG</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> normally treats <em>argv[0]</em> as a
program or command name, and returns it to the caller just as if it had
not matched <em>argTable</em>. If this flag is given, then
<em>argv[0]</em> is not given special treatment.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_NO_ABBREV</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Normally, <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> accepts unique abbreviations
for <em>key</em> values in <em>argTable</em>. If this flag is given then
only exact matches will be acceptable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_NO_LEFTOVERS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Normally, <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> returns unrecognized
arguments to the caller. If this bit is set in <em>flags</em> then
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> will return an error if it encounters any
argument that does not match <em>argTable</em>. The only exception to
this rule is <em>argv[0]</em>, which will be returned to the caller with
no errors as long as <strong>TK_ARGV_DONT_SKIP_FIRST_ARG</strong> is not
specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TK_ARGV_NO_DEFAULTS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Normally, <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> searches an internal table of
standard argument specifiers in addition to <em>argTable</em>. If this
bit is set in <em>flags</em>, then <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> will
use only <em>argTable</em> and not its default table.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Here is an example definition of an <em>argTable</em> and some sample
command lines that use the options. Note the effect on <em>argc</em> and
<em>argv</em>; arguments processed by <strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> are
eliminated from <em>argv</em>, and <em>argc</em> is updated to reflect
reduced number of arguments.</p>
<pre><code>/*
 * Define and set default values for globals.
 */
int debugFlag = 0;
int numReps = 100;
char defaultFileName[] = &quot;out&quot;;
char *fileName = defaultFileName;
Boolean exec = FALSE;

/*
 * Define option descriptions.
 */
Tk_ArgvInfo argTable[] = {
    {&quot;-X&quot;, TK_ARGV_CONSTANT, (char *) 1, (char *) &amp;debugFlag,
        &quot;Turn on debugging printfs&quot;},
    {&quot;-N&quot;, TK_ARGV_INT, NULL, (char *) &amp;numReps,
        &quot;Number of repetitions&quot;},
    {&quot;-of&quot;, TK_ARGV_STRING, NULL, (char *) &amp;fileName,
        &quot;Name of file for output&quot;},
    {&quot;x&quot;, TK_ARGV_REST, NULL, (char *) &amp;exec,
        &quot;File to exec, followed by any arguments (must be last argument).&quot;},
    {NULL, TK_ARGV_END, NULL, NULL,
        NULL}
};

main(argc, argv)
    int argc;
    char *argv[];
{
    ...

    if (Tk_ParseArgv(interp, tkwin, &amp;argc, argv, argTable, 0) != TCL_OK) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s\n&quot;, Tcl_GetString(Tcl_GetObjResult(interp)));
        exit(1);
    }

    /*
     * Remainder of the program.
     */
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that default values can be assigned to variables named in
<em>argTable</em>: the variables will only be overwritten if the
particular arguments are present in <em>argv</em>. Here are some example
command lines and their effects.</p>
<pre><code>prog -N 200 infile        # just sets the numReps variable to 200
prog -of out200 infile    # sets fileName to reference &quot;out200&quot;
prog -XN 10 infile        # sets the debug flag, also sets numReps</code></pre>
<p>In all of the above examples, <em>argc</em> will be set by
<strong>Tk_ParseArgv</strong> to 2, <em>argv</em>[0] will be
<em>argv</em>[1] will be and <em>argv</em>[2] will be NULL.</p>
