<p>Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting. If no error occurs, then
<em>*interp</em> is not modified.</p>
<p>Token for the window that is to serve as the logical parent of the
new window.</p>
<p>Name to use for this window. Must be unique among all children of the
same <em>parent</em>.</p>
<p>Has same format as <em>screenName</em>. If NULL, then new window is
created as an internal window. If non-NULL, new window is created as a
top-level window on screen <em>topLevScreen</em>. If
<em>topLevScreen</em> is an empty string then new window is created as
top-level window of <em>parent</em>'s screen.</p>
<p>Token for window.</p>
<p>Name of new window, specified as path name within application (e.g.
<strong>.a.b.c</strong>).</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The procedures <strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong>,
<strong>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</strong>, and
<strong>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</strong> are used to create new windows
for use in Tk-based applications. Each of the procedures returns a token
that can be used to manipulate the window in other calls to the Tk
library. If the window could not be created successfully, then NULL is
returned and the result of interpreter <em>interp</em> is modified to
hold an error message.</p>
<p>Tk supports two different kinds of windows: internal windows and
top-level windows. An internal window is an interior window of a Tk
application, such as a scrollbar or menu bar or button. A top-level
window is one that is created as a child of a screen's root window,
rather than as an interior window, but which is logically part of some
existing main window. Examples of top-level windows are pop-up menus and
dialog boxes.</p>
<p>New windows may be created by calling
<strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong>. If the <em>topLevScreen</em> argument
is NULL, then the new window will be an internal window. If
<em>topLevScreen</em> is non-NULL, then the new window will be a
top-level window: <em>topLevScreen</em> indicates the name of a screen
and the new window will be created as a child of the root window of
<em>topLevScreen</em>. In either case Tk will consider the new window to
be the logical child of <em>parent</em>: the new window's path name will
reflect this fact, options may be specified for the new window under
this assumption, and so on. The only difference is that new X window for
a top-level window will not be a child of <em>parent</em>'s X window.
For example, a pull-down menu's <em>parent</em> would be the button-like
window used to invoke it, which would in turn be a child of the menu bar
window. A dialog box might have the application's main window as its
parent.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</strong> differs from
<strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong> in that it creates an unnamed window.
This window will be manipulatable only using C interfaces, and will not
be visible to Tcl scripts. Both interior windows and top-level windows
may be created with <strong>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</strong> offers an alternate way of
specifying new windows. In <strong>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</strong> the
new window is specified with a token for any window in the target
application (<em>tkwin</em>), plus a path name for the new window. It
produces the same effect as <strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong> and allows
both top-level and internal windows to be created, depending on the
value of <em>topLevScreen</em>. In calls to
<strong>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</strong>, as in calls to
<strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong>, the parent of the new window must
exist at the time of the call, but the new window must not already
exist.</p>
<p>The window creation procedures do not actually issue the command to X
to create a window. Instead, they create a local data structure
associated with the window and defer the creation of the X window. The
window will actually be created by the first call to
<strong>Tk_MapWindow</strong>. Deferred window creation allows various
aspects of the window (such as its size, background color, etc.) to be
modified after its creation without incurring any overhead in the X
server. When the window is finally mapped all of the window attributes
can be set while creating the window.</p>
<p>The value returned by a window-creation procedure is not the X token
for the window (it cannot be, since X has not been asked to create the
window yet). Instead, it is a token for Tk's local data structure for
the window. Most of the Tk library procedures take Tk_Window tokens,
rather than X identifiers. The actual X window identifier can be
retrieved from the local data structure using the
<strong>Tk_WindowId</strong> macro; see the manual entry for
<strong>Tk_WindowId</strong> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DestroyWindow</strong> deletes a window and all the data
structures associated with it, including any event handlers created with
<strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong>. In addition,
<strong>Tk_DestroyWindow</strong> will delete any children of
<em>tkwin</em> recursively (where children are defined in the Tk sense,
consisting of all windows that were created with the given window as
<em>parent</em>). If <em>tkwin</em> is an internal window, then event
handlers interested in destroy events are invoked immediately. If
<em>tkwin</em> is a top-level or main window, then the event handlers
will be invoked later, after X has seen the request and returned an
event for it.</p>
<p>If a window has been created but has not been mapped, so no X window
exists, it is possible to force the creation of the X window by calling
<strong>Tk_MakeWindowExist</strong>. This procedure issues the X
commands to instantiate the window given by <em>tkwin</em>.</p>
