<p>Interpreter to use for error reporting.</p>
<p>Token for window in which colormap will be used.</p>
<p>Selects a colormap: either <strong>new</strong> or the name of a
window with the same screen and visual as <em>tkwin</em>.</p>
<p>Display for which <em>colormap</em> was allocated.</p>
<p>Colormap to free or preserve; must have been returned by a previous
call to <strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong> or
<strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures are used to manage colormaps.
<strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong> returns a colormap suitable for use in
<em>tkwin</em>. If its <em>string</em> argument is <strong>new</strong>
then a new colormap is created; otherwise <em>string</em> must be the
name of another window with the same screen and visual as
<em>tkwin</em>, and the colormap from that window is returned. If
<em>string</em> does not make sense, or if it refers to a window on a
different screen from <em>tkwin</em> or with a different visual than
<em>tkwin</em>, then <strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong> returns
<strong>None</strong> and leaves an error message in <em>interp</em>'s
result.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PreserveColormap</strong> increases the internal reference
count for a colormap previously returned by
<strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong>, which allows the colormap to be stored
in several locations without knowing which order they will be
released.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_FreeColormap</strong> should be called when a colormap
returned by <strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong> is no longer needed. Tk
maintains a reference count for each colormap returned by
<strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong>, so there should eventually be one call
to <strong>Tk_FreeColormap</strong> for each call to
<strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong> and each call to
<strong>Tk_PreserveColormap</strong>. When a colormap's reference count
becomes zero, Tk releases the X colormap.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong> and <strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong>
work together, in that a new colormap created by
<strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong> may later be returned by
<strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong>. The reference counting mechanism for
colormaps includes both procedures, so callers of
<strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong> must also call
<strong>Tk_FreeColormap</strong> to release the colormap. If
<strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong> is called with a <em>string</em> value
of <strong>new</strong> then the resulting colormap will never be
returned by <strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong>; however, it can be used in
other windows by calling <strong>Tk_GetColormap</strong> with the
original window's name as <em>string</em>.</p>
