<p>Tk_InitStubs - initialize the Tk stubs mechanism</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

const char *
Tk_InitStubs(interp, version, exact)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Tcl interpreter handle.</p>
<p>A version string consisting of one or more decimal numbers separated
by dots.</p>
<p>Non-zero means that only the particular Tk version specified by
<em>version</em> is acceptable. Zero means that versions newer than
<em>version</em> are also acceptable as long as they have the same major
version number as <em>version</em>.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The Tcl stubs mechanism defines a way to dynamically bind extensions
to a particular Tcl implementation at run time. the stubs mechanism
requires no changes to applications incorporating Tcl/Tk interpreters.
Only developers creating C-based Tcl/Tk extensions need to take steps to
use the stubs mechanism with their extensions. See the
<strong>Tcl_InitStubs</strong> page for more information.</p>
<p>Enabling the stubs mechanism for a Tcl/Tk extension requires the
following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Call <strong>Tcl_InitStubs</strong> in the extension before
calling any other Tcl functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Call <strong>Tk_InitStubs</strong> if the extension before
calling any other Tk functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the <strong>USE_TCL_STUBS</strong> and the
<strong>USE_TK_STUBS</strong> symbols. Typically, you would include the
<strong>-DUSE_TCL_STUBS</strong> and the <strong>-DUSE_TK_STUBS</strong>
flags when compiling the extension.</p></li>
<li><p>Link the extension with the Tcl and Tk stubs libraries instead of
the standard Tcl and Tk libraries. On Unix platforms, the library names
are <em>libtclstub8.4.a</em> and <em>libtkstub8.4.a</em>; on Windows
platforms, the library names are <em>tclstub84.lib</em> and
<em>tkstub84.lib</em>. Adjust the library names with appropriate version
number but note that the extension may only be used with versions of
Tcl/Tk that have that version number or higher.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_InitStubs</strong> attempts to initialize the Tk stub
table pointers and ensure that the correct version of Tk is loaded. In
addition to an interpreter handle, it accepts as arguments a version
number and a Boolean flag indicating whether the extension requires an
exact version match or not. If <em>exact</em> is 0, then the extension
is indicating that newer versions of Tk are acceptable as long as they
have the same major version number as <em>version</em>; non-zero means
that only the specified <em>version</em> is acceptable.
<strong>Tcl_InitStubs</strong> returns a string containing the actual
version of Tk satisfying the request, or NULL if the Tk version is not
acceptable, does not support the stubs mechanism, or any other error
condition occurred.</p>
