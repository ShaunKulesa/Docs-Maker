<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tk_Main - main program for Tk-based applications</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

Tk_Main(argc, argv, appInitProc)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Number of elements in <em>argv</em>.</p>
<p>Array of strings containing command-line arguments. On Windows, when
using -DUNICODE, the parameter type changes to wchar_t *.</p>
<p>Address of an application-specific initialization procedure. The
value for this argument is usually <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_Main</strong> acts as the main program for most Tk-based
applications. Starting with Tk 4.0 it is not called
<strong>main</strong> anymore because it is part of the Tk library and
having a function <strong>main</strong> in a library (particularly a
shared library) causes problems on many systems. Having
<strong>main</strong> in the Tk library would also make it hard to use
Tk in C++ programs, since C++ programs must have special C++
<strong>main</strong> functions.</p>
<p>Normally each application contains a small <strong>main</strong>
function that does nothing but invoke <strong>Tk_Main</strong>.
<strong>Tk_Main</strong> then does all the work of creating and running
a <strong>wish</strong>-like application.</p>
<p>When it is has finished its own initialization, but before it
processes commands, <strong>Tk_Main</strong> calls the procedure given
by the <em>appInitProc</em> argument. This procedure provides a for the
application to perform its own initialization, such as defining
application-specific commands. The procedure must have an interface that
matches the type <strong>Tcl_AppInitProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p><em>AppInitProc</em> is almost always a pointer to
<strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong>; for more details on this procedure, see
the documentation for <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_Main</strong> functions much the same as
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong>. In particular, <strong>Tk_Main</strong>
supports both an interactive mode and a startup script mode, with the
file name and encoding of a startup script under the control of the
<strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GetStartupScript</strong> routines. However it calls
<strong>Tk_MainLoop</strong> after processing any supplied script, and
in interactive uses events registered with
<strong>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</strong> to process user input.</p>
