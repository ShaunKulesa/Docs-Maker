<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

int
Tk_GetDash(interp, string, dashPtr)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter to use for error reporting.</p>
<p>Textual value to be converted.</p>
<p>Points to place to store the dash pattern value converted from
<em>string</em>. Must not be NULL.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedure parses the string and fills in the result in the
Tk_Dash structure. The string can be a list of integers or a character
string containing only and spaces. If all goes well,
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned and a dash descriptor is stored in
the variable pointed to by <em>dashPtr</em>. If <em>string</em> does not
have the proper syntax then <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned, an
error message is left in the interpreter's result, and nothing is stored
at *<em>dashPtr</em>.</p>
<p>The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element
represents the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd segments
are drawn using the color. The other segments are drawn transparent.</p>
<p>The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5
possible characters The space can be used to enlarge the space between
other line elements, and can not occur in the first position of the
string. Some examples:</p>
<pre><code>    -dash .     = -dash {2 4}
    -dash -     = -dash {6 4}
    -dash -.    = -dash {6 4 2 4}
    -dash -..   = -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
    -dash {. }  = -dash {2 8}
    -dash ,     = -dash {4 4}</code></pre>
<p>The main difference between this syntax and the numeric is that it is
shape-conserving. This means that all values in the dash list will be
multiplied by the line width before display. This ensures that will
always be displayed as a dot and always as a dash regardless of the line
width.</p>
<p>On systems where only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash
pattern will be displayed as the most close dash pattern that is
available. For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the above
examples are available; the last 2 examples will be displayed
identically to the first one.</p>
