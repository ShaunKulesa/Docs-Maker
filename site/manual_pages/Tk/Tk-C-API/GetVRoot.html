<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Token for window whose virtual root is to be queried.</p>
<p>Points to word in which to store x-offset of virtual root.</p>
<p>Points to word in which to store y-offset of virtual root.</p>
<p>Points to word in which to store width of virtual root.</p>
<p>Points to word in which to store height of virtual root.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_GetVRootGeometry</strong> returns geometry information
about the virtual root window associated with <em>tkwin</em>. The
virtual root is the one in which <em>tkwin</em>'s nearest top-level
ancestor (or <em>tkwin</em> itself if it is a top-level window) has been
reparented by the window manager. This window is identified by a
<strong>__SWM_ROOT</strong> or <strong>__WM_ROOT</strong> property
placed on the top-level window by the window manager. If <em>tkwin</em>
is not associated with a virtual root (e.g.Â because the window manager
does not use virtual roots) then *<em>xPtr</em> and *<em>yPtr</em> will
be set to 0 and *<em>widthPtr</em> and *<em>heightPtr</em> will be set
to the dimensions of the screen containing <em>tkwin</em>.</p>
