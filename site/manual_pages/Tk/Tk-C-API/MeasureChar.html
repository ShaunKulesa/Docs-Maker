<p>Tk_MeasureChars, Tk_TextWidth, Tk_DrawChars, Tk_UnderlineChars -
routines to measure and display simple single-line strings.</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

int
Tk_MeasureChars(tkfont, string, numBytes, maxPixels, flags, lengthPtr)

int
Tk_TextWidth(tkfont, string, numBytes)

Tk_DrawChars(display, drawable, gc, tkfont, string, numBytes, x, y)

Tk_UnderlineChars(display, drawable, gc, tkfont, string, x, y, firstByte, lastByte)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Token for font in which text is to be drawn or measured. Must have
been returned by a previous call to <strong>Tk_GetFont</strong>.</p>
<p>Text to be measured or displayed. Need not be null terminated. Any
non-printing meta-characters in the string (such as tabs, newlines, and
other control characters) will be measured or displayed in a
platform-dependent manner.</p>
<p>The maximum number of bytes to consider when measuring or drawing
<em>string</em>. Must be greater than or equal to 0.</p>
<p>If <em>maxPixels</em> is &gt;= 0, it specifies the longest
permissible line length in pixels. Characters from <em>string</em> are
processed only until this many pixels have been covered. If
<em>maxPixels</em> is &lt; 0, then the line length is unbounded and the
<em>flags</em> argument is ignored.</p>
<p>Various flag bits OR-ed together: <strong>TK_PARTIAL_OK</strong>
means include a character as long as any part of it fits in the length
given by <em>maxPixels</em>; otherwise, a character must fit completely
to be considered. <strong>TK_WHOLE_WORDS</strong> means stop on a word
boundary, if possible. If <strong>TK_AT_LEAST_ONE</strong> is set, it
means return at least one character even if no characters could fit in
the length given by <em>maxPixels</em>. If
<strong>TK_AT_LEAST_ONE</strong> is set and
<strong>TK_WHOLE_WORDS</strong> is also set, it means that if not even
one word fits on the line, return the first few letters of the word that
did fit; if not even one letter of the word fit, then the first letter
will still be returned.</p>
<p>Filled with the number of pixels occupied by the number of characters
returned as the result of <strong>Tk_MeasureChars</strong>.</p>
<p>Display on which to draw.</p>
<p>Window or pixmap in which to draw.</p>
<p>Graphics context for drawing characters. The font selected into this
GC must be the same as the <em>tkfont</em>.</p>
<p>Coordinates at which to place the left edge of the baseline when
displaying <em>string</em>.</p>
<p>The index of the first byte of the first character to underline in
the <em>string</em>. Underlining begins at the left edge of this
character.</p>
<p>The index of the first byte of the last character up to which the
underline will be drawn. The character specified by <em>lastByte</em>
will not itself be underlined.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These routines are for measuring and displaying simple single-font,
single-line strings. To measure and display single-font, multi-line,
justified text, refer to the documentation for
<strong>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</strong>. There is no programming interface
in the core of Tk that supports multi-font, multi-line text; support for
that behavior must be built on top of simpler layers. Note that the
interfaces described here are byte-oriented not character-oriented, so
index values coming from Tcl scripts need to be converted to byte
offsets using the <strong>Tcl_UtfAtIndex</strong> and related
routines.</p>
<p>A glyph is the displayable picture of a letter, number, or some other
symbol. Not all character codes in a given font have a glyph. Characters
such as tabs, newlines/returns, and control characters that have no
glyph are measured and displayed by these procedures in a
platform-dependent manner; under X, they are replaced with backslashed
escape sequences, while under Windows and Macintosh hollow or solid
boxes may be substituted. Refer to the documentation for
<strong>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</strong> for a programming interface that
supports the platform-independent expansion of tab characters into
columns and newlines/returns into multi-line text.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_MeasureChars</strong> is used both to compute the length
of a given string and to compute how many characters from a string fit
in a given amount of space. The return value is the number of bytes from
<em>string</em> that fit in the space specified by <em>maxPixels</em>
subject to the conditions described by <em>flags</em>. If all characters
fit, the return value will be <em>numBytes</em>. <em>*lengthPtr</em> is
filled with the computed width, in pixels, of the portion of the string
that was measured. For example, if the return value is 5, then
<em>*lengthPtr</em> is filled with the distance between the left edge of
<em>string</em>[0] and the right edge of <em>string</em>[4].</p>
<p><strong>Tk_TextWidth</strong> is a wrapper function that provides a
simpler interface to the <strong>Tk_MeasureChars</strong> function. The
return value is how much space in pixels the given <em>string</em>
needs.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DrawChars</strong> draws the <em>string</em> at the given
location in the given <em>drawable</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_UnderlineChars</strong> underlines the given range of
characters in the given <em>string</em>. It does not draw the characters
(which are assumed to have been displayed previously by
<strong>Tk_DrawChars</strong>); it just draws the underline. This
procedure is used to underline a few characters without having to
construct an underlined font. To produce natively underlined text, the
appropriate underlined font should be constructed and used.</p>
