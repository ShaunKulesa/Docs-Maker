<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_FindPhoto</strong> returns an opaque handle that is used
to identify a particular photo image to the other procedures. The
parameter is the name of the image, that is, the name specified to the
<strong>image create</strong> photo command, or assigned by that command
if no name was specified. If <em>imageName</em> does not exist or is not
a photo image, <strong>Tk_FindPhoto</strong> returns NULL.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> is used to supply blocks of image
data to be displayed. The call affects an area of the image of size
<em>width</em> x <em>height</em> pixels, with its top-left corner at
coordinates (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>). All of <em>width</em>,
<em>height</em>, <em>x</em>, and <em>y</em> must be non-negative. If
part of this area lies outside the current bounds of the image, the
image will be expanded to include the area, unless the user has
specified an explicit image size with the <strong>-width</strong> and/or
<strong>-height</strong> widget configuration options (see photo(n)); in
that case the area is silently clipped to the image boundaries.</p>
<p>The <em>block</em> parameter is a pointer to a
<strong>Tk_PhotoImageBlock</strong> structure, defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
    unsigned char *pixelPtr;
    int width;
    int height;
    int pitch;
    int pixelSize;
    int offset[4];
} Tk_PhotoImageBlock;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>pixelPtr</em> field points to the first pixel, that is, the
top-left pixel in the block. The <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>
fields specify the dimensions of the block of pixels. The
<em>pixelSize</em> field specifies the address difference between two
horizontally adjacent pixels. It should be 4 for RGB and 2 for grayscale
image data. Other values are possible, if the offsets in the
<em>offset</em> array are adjusted accordingly (e.g.Â for red, green and
blue data stored in different planes). Using such a layout is strongly
discouraged, though. Due to a bug, it might not work correctly if an
alpha channel is provided. (see the <strong>BUGS</strong> section
below). The <em>pitch</em> field specifies the address difference
between two vertically adjacent pixels. The <em>offset</em> array
contains the offsets from the address of a pixel to the addresses of the
bytes containing the red, green, blue and alpha (transparency)
components. If the offsets for red, green and blue are equal, the image
is interpreted as grayscale. If they differ, RGB data is assumed.
Normally the offsets will be 0, 1, 2, 3 for RGB data and 0, 0, 0, 1 for
grayscale. It is possible to provide image data without an alpha channel
by setting the offset for alpha to a negative value and adjusting the
<em>pixelSize</em> field accordingly. This use is discouraged, though
(see the <strong>BUGS</strong> section below).</p>
<p>The <em>compRule</em> parameter to <strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong>
specifies a compositing rule that says what to do with transparent
pixels. The value <strong>TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY</strong> says that
the previous contents of the photo image should show through, and the
value <strong>TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_SET</strong> says that the previous
contents of the photo image should be completely ignored, and the values
from the block be copied directly across. The behavior in Tk8.3 and
earlier was equivalent to having
<strong>TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY</strong> as a compositing rule.</p>
<p>The value given for the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> parameters
to <strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> do not have to correspond to the
values specified in <em>block</em>. If they are smaller,
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> extracts a sub-block from the image
data supplied. If they are larger, the data given are replicated (in a
tiled fashion) to fill the specified area. These rules operate
independently in the horizontal and vertical directions.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> normally returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, though if it cannot allocate sufficient memory
to hold the resulting image, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned
instead and, if the <em>interp</em> argument is non-NULL, an error
message is placed in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</strong> works like
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> except that the image can be reduced
or enlarged for display. The <em>subsampleX</em> and <em>subsampleY</em>
parameters allow the size of the image to be reduced by subsampling.
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</strong> will use only pixels from the
input image whose X coordinates are multiples of <em>subsampleX</em>,
and whose Y coordinates are multiples of <em>subsampleY</em>. For
example, an image of 512x512 pixels can be reduced to 256x256 by setting
<em>subsampleX</em> and <em>subsampleY</em> to 2.</p>
<p>The <em>zoomX</em> and <em>zoomY</em> parameters allow the image to
be enlarged by pixel replication. Each pixel of the (possibly
subsampled) input image will be written to a block <em>zoomX</em> pixels
wide and <em>zoomY</em> pixels high of the displayed image. Subsampling
and zooming can be used together for special effects.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoGetImage</strong> can be used to retrieve image data
from a photo image. <strong>Tk_PhotoGetImage</strong> fills in the
structure pointed to by the <em>blockPtr</em> parameter with values that
describe the address and layout of the image data that the photo image
has stored internally. The values are valid until the image is destroyed
or its size is changed.</p>
<p>It is possible to modify an image by writing directly to the data the
<em>pixelPtr</em> field points to. The size of the image cannot be
changed this way, though. Also, changes made by writing directly to
<em>pixelPtr</em> will not be immediately visible, but only after a call
to <strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong> or after an event that causes the
interested widgets to redraw themselves. For these reasons usually it is
preferable to make changes to a copy of the image data and write it back
with <strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> or
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoGetImage</strong> returns 1 for compatibility with
the corresponding procedure in the old photo widget.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoBlank</strong> blanks the entire area of the photo
image. Blank areas of a photo image are transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoExpand</strong> requests that the widget's image be
expanded to be at least <em>width</em> x <em>height</em> pixels in size.
The width and/or height are unchanged if the user has specified an
explicit image width or height with the <strong>-width</strong> and/or
<strong>-height</strong> configuration options, respectively. If the
image data are being supplied in many small blocks, it is more efficient
to use <strong>Tk_PhotoExpand</strong> or
<strong>Tk_PhotoSetSize</strong> at the beginning rather than allowing
the image to expand in many small increments as image blocks are
supplied.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoExpand</strong> normally returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, though if it cannot allocate sufficient memory
to hold the resulting image, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned
instead and, if the <em>interp</em> argument is non-NULL, an error
message is placed in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoSetSize</strong> specifies the size of the image, as
if the user had specified the given <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>
values to the <strong>-width</strong> and <strong>-height</strong>
configuration options. A value of zero for <em>width</em> or
<em>height</em> does not change the image's width or height, but allows
the width or height to be changed by subsequent calls to
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong>,
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</strong> or
<strong>Tk_PhotoExpand</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoSetSize</strong> normally returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, though if it cannot allocate sufficient memory
to hold the resulting image, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned
instead and, if the <em>interp</em> argument is non-NULL, an error
message is placed in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_PhotoGetSize</strong> returns the dimensions of the image
in *<em>widthPtr</em> and *<em>heightPtr</em>.</p>
<h1 id="portability">PORTABILITY</h1>
<p>In Tk 8.3 and earlier, <strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> and
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</strong> had different signatures. If you
want to compile code that uses the old interface against 8.4 without
updating your code, compile it with the flag
-DUSE_COMPOSITELESS_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK. Code linked using Stubs against
older versions of Tk will continue to work.</p>
<p>In Tk 8.4, <strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong>,
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</strong>, <strong>Tk_PhotoExpand</strong>
and <strong>Tk_PhotoSetSize</strong> did not take an <em>interp</em>
argument or return any result code. If insufficient memory was available
for an image, Tk would panic. This behaviour is still supported if you
compile your extension with the additional flag
-DUSE_PANIC_ON_PHOTO_ALLOC_FAILURE. Code linked using Stubs against
older versions of Tk will continue to work.</p>
<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tk_PhotoImageBlock</strong> structure used to provide
image data to <strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> promises great
flexibility in the layout of the data (e.g.Â separate planes for the red,
green, blue and alpha channels). Unfortunately, the implementation fails
to hold this promise. The problem is that the <em>pixelSize</em> field
is (incorrectly) used to determine whether the image has an alpha
channel. Currently, if the offset for the alpha channel is greater or
equal than <em>pixelSize</em>, <strong>tk_PhotoPutblock</strong> assumes
no alpha data is present and makes the image fully opaque. This means
that for layouts where the channels are separate (or any other exotic
layout where <em>pixelSize</em> has to be smaller than the alpha
offset), the alpha channel will not be read correctly. In order to be on
the safe side if this issue will be corrected in a future release, it is
strongly recommended you always provide alpha data - even if the image
has no transparency - and only use the "standard" layout with a
<em>pixelSize</em> of 2 for grayscale and 4 for RGB data with
<em>offset</em>s of 0, 0, 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively.</p>
