<p>Tk_CreateEventHandler, Tk_DeleteEventHandler - associate procedure
callback with an X event</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

Tk_CreateEventHandler(tkwin, mask, proc, clientData)

Tk_DeleteEventHandler(tkwin, mask, proc, clientData)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Token for window in which events may occur.</p>
<p>Bit-mask of events (such as <strong>ButtonPressMask</strong>) for
which <em>proc</em> should be called.</p>
<p>Procedure to invoke whenever an event in <em>mask</em> occurs in the
window given by <em>tkwin</em>.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong> arranges for <em>proc</em> to
be invoked in the future whenever one of the event types specified by
<em>mask</em> occurs in the window specified by <em>tkwin</em>. The
callback to <em>proc</em> will be made by
<strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>; this mechanism only works in programs
that dispatch events through <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong> (or through
other Tk procedures that call <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>, such as
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or <strong>Tk_MainLoop</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tk_EventProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tk_EventProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        XEvent *eventPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to
<strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong> when the callback was created.
Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to a data structure containing
application-specific information about the window in which the event
occurred. <em>EventPtr</em> is a pointer to the X event, which will be
one of the ones specified in the <em>mask</em> argument to
<strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteEventHandler</strong> may be called to delete a
previously-created event handler: it deletes the first handler it finds
that is associated with <em>tkwin</em> and matches the <em>mask</em>,
<em>proc</em>, and <em>clientData</em> arguments. If no such handler
exists, then <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong> returns without doing
anything. Although Tk supports it, it's probably a bad idea to have more
than one callback with the same <em>mask</em>, <em>proc</em>, and
<em>clientData</em> arguments. When a window is deleted all of its
handlers will be deleted automatically; in this case there is no need to
call <strong>Tk_DeleteEventHandler</strong>.</p>
<p>If multiple handlers are declared for the same type of X event on the
same window, then the handlers will be invoked in the order they were
created.</p>
