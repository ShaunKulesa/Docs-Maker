<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In general, a window should never set its own position; this should
be done only by the geometry manger that is responsible for the window.
For top-level windows the window manager is effectively the geometry
manager; Tk provides interface code between the application and the
window manager to convey the application's desires to the geometry
manager. The desired size for a top-level window is conveyed using the
usual <strong>Tk_GeometryRequest</strong> mechanism. The procedure
<strong>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</strong> may be used by an application to
request a particular position for a top-level window; this procedure is
similar in function to the <strong>wm geometry</strong> Tcl command
except that negative offsets cannot be specified. It is invoked by
widgets such as menus that want to appear at a particular place on the
screen.</p>
<p>When <strong>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</strong> is called it does not
immediately pass on the new desired location to the window manager; it
defers this action until all other outstanding work has been completed,
using the <strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> mechanism.</p>
