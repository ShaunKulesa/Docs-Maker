<p>Tk_CollapseMotionEvents, Tk_QueueWindowEvent - Add a window event to
the Tcl event queue</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

int
Tk_CollapseMotionEvents(display, collapse)

Tk_QueueWindowEvent(eventPtr, position)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Display for which to control motion event collapsing.</p>
<p>Indicates whether motion events should be collapsed or not.</p>
<p>An event to add to the event queue. It is important that all unused
fields of the structure be set to zero.</p>
<p>Where to add the new event in the queue:
<strong>TCL_QUEUE_TAIL</strong>, <strong>TCL_QUEUE_HEAD</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_QUEUE_MARK</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_QueueWindowEvent</strong> places a window event on Tcl's
internal event queue for eventual servicing. It creates a Tcl_Event
structure, copies the event into that structure, and calls
<strong>Tcl_QueueEvent</strong> to add the event to the queue. When the
event is eventually removed from the queue it is processed just like all
window events.</p>
<p>When multiple motion events are received for the same window in rapid
succession, they are collapsed by default. This behavior can be
controlled with <strong>Tk_CollapseMotionEvents</strong>.
<strong>Tk_CollapseMotionEvents</strong> always returns the previous
value for collapse behavior on the <em>display</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>position</em> argument to
<strong>Tk_QueueWindowEvent</strong> has the same significance as for
<strong>Tcl_QueueEvent</strong>; see the documentation for
<strong>Tcl_QueueEvent</strong> for details.</p>
