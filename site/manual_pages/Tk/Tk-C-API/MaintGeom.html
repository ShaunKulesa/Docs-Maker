<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_MaintainGeometry</strong> and
<strong>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</strong> make it easier for geometry
managers to deal with windows whose containers are not their parents.
Three problems arise if the container for a window is not its
parent:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The x- and y-position of the window must be translated from the
coordinate system of the container to that of the parent before
positioning the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the container window, or any of its ancestors up to the window's
parent, is moved, then the window must be repositioned within its parent
in order to maintain the correct position relative to the container.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the container or one of its ancestors is mapped or unmapped, then
the window must be mapped or unmapped to correspond.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>None of these problems is an issue if the parent and container are
the same. For example, if the container or one of its ancestors is
unmapped, the window is automatically removed by the screen by X.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_MaintainGeometry</strong> deals with these problems for
windows whose containers are not their parents, as well as handling the
simpler case of windows whose container are their parents.
<strong>Tk_MaintainGeometry</strong> is typically called by a window
manager once it has decided where a window should be positioned relative
to its container. <strong>Tk_MaintainGeometry</strong> translates the
coordinates to the coordinate system of <em>window</em>'s parent and
then moves and resizes the window appropriately. Furthermore, it
remembers the desired position and creates event handlers to monitor the
container and all of its ancestors up to (but not including) the
window's parent. If any of these windows is moved, mapped, or unmapped,
the window will be adjusted so that it is mapped only when the container
is mapped and its geometry relative to the container remains as
specified by <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>width</em>, and
<em>height</em>.</p>
<p>When a window manager relinquishes control over a window, or if it
decides that it does not want the window to appear on the screen under
any conditions, it calls <strong>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</strong>.
<strong>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</strong> unmaps the window and cancels any
previous calls to <strong>Tk_MaintainGeometry</strong> for the
<em>container</em>-<em>window</em> pair, so that the window's geometry
and mapped state are no longer maintained automatically.
<strong>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</strong> need not be called by a geometry
manager if the window, the container, or any of the container's
ancestors is destroyed: Tk will call it automatically.</p>
<p>If <strong>Tk_MaintainGeometry</strong> is called repeatedly for the
same <em>container</em>-<em>window</em> pair, the information from the
most recent call supersedes any older information. If
<strong>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</strong> is called for a
<em>container</em>-<em>window</em> pair that is is not currently
managed, the call has no effect.</p>
