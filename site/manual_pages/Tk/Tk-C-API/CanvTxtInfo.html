<p>A token that identifies a particular canvas widget.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Textual canvas items are somewhat more complicated to manage than
other items, due to things like the selection and the input focus.
<strong>Tk_CanvasGetTextInfo</strong> may be invoked by a type manager
to obtain additional information needed for items that display text. The
return value from <strong>Tk_CanvasGetTextInfo</strong> is a pointer to
a structure that is shared between Tk and all the items that display
text. The structure has the following form:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tk_CanvasTextInfo {
    Tk_3DBorder selBorder;
    int selBorderWidth;
    XColor *selFgColorPtr;
    Tk_Item *selItemPtr;
    int selectFirst;
    int selectLast;
    Tk_Item *anchorItemPtr;
    int selectAnchor;
    Tk_3DBorder insertBorder;
    int insertWidth;
    int insertBorderWidth;
    Tk_Item *focusItemPtr;
    int gotFocus;
    int cursorOn;
} Tk_CanvasTextInfo;</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>selBorder</strong> field identifies a Tk_3DBorder that
should be used for drawing the background under selected text.
<em>selBorderWidth</em> gives the width of the raised border around
selected text, in pixels. <em>selFgColorPtr</em> points to an XColor
that describes the foreground color to be used when drawing selected
text. <em>selItemPtr</em> points to the item that is currently selected,
or NULL if there is no item selected or if the canvas does not have the
selection. <em>selectFirst</em> and <em>selectLast</em> give the indices
of the first and last selected characters in <em>selItemPtr</em>, as
returned by the <em>indexProc</em> for that item. <em>anchorItemPtr</em>
points to the item that currently has the selection anchor; this is not
necessarily the same as <em>selItemPtr</em>. <em>selectAnchor</em> is an
index that identifies the anchor position within <em>anchorItemPtr</em>.
<em>insertBorder</em> contains a Tk_3DBorder to use when drawing the
insertion cursor; <em>insertWidth</em> gives the total width of the
insertion cursor in pixels, and <em>insertBorderWidth</em> gives the
width of the raised border around the insertion cursor.
<em>focusItemPtr</em> identifies the item that currently has the input
focus, or NULL if there is no such item. <em>gotFocus</em> is 1 if the
canvas widget has the input focus and 0 otherwise. <em>cursorOn</em> is
1 if the insertion cursor should be drawn in <em>focusItemPtr</em> and 0
if it should not be drawn; this field is toggled on and off by Tk to
make the cursor blink.</p>
<p>The structure returned by <strong>Tk_CanvasGetTextInfo</strong> is
shared between Tk and the type managers; typically the type manager
calls <strong>Tk_CanvasGetTextInfo</strong> once when an item is created
and then saves the pointer in the item's record. Tk will update
information in the Tk_CanvasTextInfo; for example, a
<strong>configure</strong> widget command might change the
<em>selBorder</em> field, or a <strong>select</strong> widget command
might change the <em>selectFirst</em> field, or Tk might change
<em>cursorOn</em> in order to make the insertion cursor flash on and off
during successive redisplays.</p>
<p>Type managers should treat all of the fields of the Tk_CanvasTextInfo
structure as read-only, except for <em>selItemPtr</em>,
<em>selectFirst</em>, <em>selectLast</em>, and <em>selectAnchor</em>.
Type managers may change <em>selectFirst</em>, <em>selectLast</em>, and
<em>selectAnchor</em> to adjust for insertions and deletions in the item
(but only if the item is the current owner of the selection or anchor,
as determined by <em>selItemPtr</em> or <em>anchorItemPtr</em>). If all
of the selected text in the item is deleted, the item should set
<em>selItemPtr</em> to NULL to indicate that there is no longer a
selection.</p>
