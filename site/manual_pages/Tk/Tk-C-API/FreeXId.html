<p>Tk_FreeXId - make X resource identifier available for reuse</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

Tk_FreeXId(display, id)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Display for which <em>id</em> was allocated.</p>
<p>Identifier of X resource (window, font, pixmap, cursor, graphics
context, or colormap) that is no longer in use.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The default allocator for resource identifiers provided by Xlib is
very simple-minded and does not allow resource identifiers to be
re-used. If a long-running application reaches the end of the resource
id space, it will generate an X protocol error and crash. Tk replaces
the default id allocator with its own allocator, which allows
identifiers to be reused. In order for this to work,
<strong>Tk_FreeXId</strong> must be called to tell the allocator about
resources that have been freed. Tk automatically calls
<strong>Tk_FreeXId</strong> whenever it frees a resource, so if you use
procedures like <strong>Tk_GetFont</strong>, <strong>Tk_GetGC</strong>,
and <strong>Tk_GetPixmap</strong> then you need not call
<strong>Tk_FreeXId</strong>. However, if you allocate resources directly
from Xlib, for example by calling <strong>XCreatePixmap</strong>, then
you should call <strong>Tk_FreeXId</strong> when you call the
corresponding Xlib free procedure, such as <strong>XFreePixmap</strong>.
If you do not call <strong>Tk_FreeXId</strong> then the resource
identifier will be lost, which could cause problems if the application
runs long enough to lose all of the available identifiers.</p>
