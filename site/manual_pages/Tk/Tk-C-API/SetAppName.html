<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tk_SetAppName - Set the name of an application for 'send'
commands</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

const char *
Tk_SetAppName(tkwin, name)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Token for window in application. Used only to select a particular
application.</p>
<p>Name under which to register the application.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_SetAppName</strong> associates a name with a given
application and records that association on the display containing with
the application's main window. After this procedure has been invoked,
other applications on the display will be able to use the
<strong>send</strong> command to invoke operations in the application.
If <em>name</em> is already in use by some other application on the
display, then a new name will be generated by appending to
<em>name</em>; if this name is also in use, the number will be
incremented until an unused name is found. The return value from the
procedure is a pointer to the name actually used.</p>
<p>If the application already has a name when
<strong>Tk_SetAppName</strong> is called, then the new name replaces the
old name.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_SetAppName</strong> also adds a <strong>send</strong>
command to the application's interpreter, which can be used to send
commands from this application to others on any of the displays where
the application has windows.</p>
<p>The application's name registration persists until the interpreter is
deleted or the <strong>send</strong> command is deleted from
<em>interp</em>, at which point the name is automatically unregistered
and the application becomes inaccessible via <strong>send</strong>. The
application can be made accessible again by calling
<strong>Tk_SetAppName</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_SetAppName</strong> is called automatically by
<strong>Tk_Init</strong>, so applications do not normally need to call
it explicitly.</p>
<p>The command <strong>tk appname</strong> provides Tcl-level access to
the functionality of <strong>Tk_SetAppName</strong>.</p>
