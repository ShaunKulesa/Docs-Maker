<p>Interpreter to use for reporting errors.</p>
<p>Window that determines which display's clipboard to manipulate.</p>
<p>Conversion type for this clipboard item; has same meaning as
<em>target</em> argument to <strong>Tk_CreateSelHandler</strong>.</p>
<p>Representation to use when data is retrieved; has same meaning as
<em>format</em> argument to <strong>Tk_CreateSelHandler</strong>.</p>
<p>Null terminated string containing the data to be appended to the
clipboard.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These two procedures manage the clipboard for Tk. The clipboard is
typically managed by calling <strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong> once,
then calling <strong>Tk_ClipboardAppend</strong> to add data for any
number of targets.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong> claims the CLIPBOARD selection and
frees any data items previously stored on the clipboard in this
application. It normally returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong>, but if an
error occurs it returns <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> and leaves an error
message in interpreter <em>interp</em>'s result.
<strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong> must be called before a sequence of
<strong>Tk_ClipboardAppend</strong> calls can be issued.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_ClipboardAppend</strong> appends a buffer of data to the
clipboard. The first buffer for a given <em>target</em> determines the
<em>format</em> for that <em>target</em>. Any successive appends for
that <em>target</em> must have the same format or an error will be
returned. <strong>Tk_ClipboardAppend</strong> returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> if the buffer is successfully copied onto the
clipboard. If the clipboard is not currently owned by the application,
either because <strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong> has not been called or
because ownership of the clipboard has changed since the last call to
<strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong>, <strong>Tk_ClipboardAppend</strong>
returns <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> and leaves an error message in the
result of interpreter <em>interp</em>.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee atomicity, no event handling should occur
between <strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong> and the following
<strong>Tk_ClipboardAppend</strong> calls (otherwise someone could
retrieve a partially completed clipboard or claim ownership away from
this application).</p>
<p><strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong> may invoke callbacks, including
arbitrary Tcl scripts, as a result of losing the CLIPBOARD selection, so
any calling function should take care to be re-entrant at the point
<strong>Tk_ClipboardClear</strong> is invoked.</p>
