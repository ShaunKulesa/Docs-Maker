<p>Tk_InitConsoleChannels - Install the console channels as standard
channels</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

Tk_InitConsoleChannels(interp)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter in which the console channels are created.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_InitConsoleChannels</strong> is invoked to create a set of
console channels and install them as the standard channels. All I/O on
these channels will be discarded until
<strong>Tk_CreateConsoleWindow</strong> is called to attach the console
to a text widget.</p>
<p>This function is for use by shell applications based on Tk, like
<strong>wish</strong>, on platforms which have no standard channels in
graphical mode, like Win32.</p>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument is the interpreter in which to create
and install the console channels.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If this function is used it has to be called
before the first call to <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>, directly,
or indirectly through other channel functions. Because otherwise the
standard channels will be already initialized to the system defaults,
which will be nonsensical for the case
<strong>Tk_InitConsoleChannels</strong> is for.</p>
