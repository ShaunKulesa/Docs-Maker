<p>Tk_RestrictEvents - filter and selectively delay X events</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

Tk_RestrictProc *
Tk_RestrictEvents(proc, arg, prevArgPtr)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Predicate procedure to call to filter incoming X events. NULL means
do not restrict events at all.</p>
<p>Arbitrary argument to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<p>Pointer to place to save argument to previous restrict procedure.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This procedure is useful in certain situations where applications are
only prepared to receive certain X events. After
<strong>Tk_RestrictEvents</strong> is called,
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> (and hence <strong>Tk_MainLoop</strong>)
will filter X input events through <em>proc</em>. <em>Proc</em>
indicates whether a given event is to be processed immediately, deferred
until some later time (e.g.Â when the event restriction is lifted), or
discarded. <em>Proc</em> is a procedure with arguments and result that
match the type <strong>Tk_RestrictProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef Tk_RestrictAction Tk_RestrictProc(
        ClientData arg,
        XEvent *eventPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>arg</em> argument is a copy of the <em>arg</em> passed to
<strong>Tk_RestrictEvents</strong>; it may be used to provide
<em>proc</em> with information it needs to filter events. The
<em>eventPtr</em> points to an event under consideration. <em>Proc</em>
returns a restrict action (enumerated type
<strong>Tk_RestrictAction</strong>) that indicates what
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> should do with the event. If the return
value is <strong>TK_PROCESS_EVENT</strong>, then the event will be
handled immediately. If the return value is
<strong>TK_DEFER_EVENT</strong>, then the event will be left on the
event queue for later processing. If the return value is
<strong>TK_DISCARD_EVENT</strong>, then the event will be removed from
the event queue and discarded without being processed.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_RestrictEvents</strong> uses its return value and
<em>prevArgPtr</em> to return information about the current event
restriction procedure (a NULL return value means there are currently no
restrictions). These values may be used to restore the previous
restriction state when there is no longer any need for the current
restriction.</p>
<p>There are very few places where <strong>Tk_RestrictEvents</strong> is
needed. In most cases, the best way to restrict events is by changing
the bindings with the <strong>bind</strong> Tcl command or by calling
<strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong> and
<strong>Tk_DeleteEventHandler</strong> from C. The main place where
<strong>Tk_RestrictEvents</strong> must be used is when performing
synchronous actions (for example, if you need to wait for a particular
event to occur on a particular window but you do not want to invoke any
handlers for any other events). The solution in these situations is to
call <strong>XNextEvent</strong> or <strong>XWindowEvent</strong>, but
these procedures cannot be used because Tk keeps its own event queue
that is separate from the X event queue. Instead, call
<strong>Tk_RestrictEvents</strong> to set up a filter, then call
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> to retrieve the desired event(s).</p>
