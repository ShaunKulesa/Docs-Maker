<p>Token for window.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures may be used to map and unmap windows managed by Tk.
<strong>Tk_MapWindow</strong> maps the window given by <em>tkwin</em>,
and also creates an X window corresponding to <em>tkwin</em> if it does
not already exist. See the <strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong> manual entry
for information on deferred window creation.
<strong>Tk_UnmapWindow</strong> unmaps <em>tkwin</em>'s window from the
screen.</p>
<p>If <em>tkwin</em> is a child window
(i.e.Â <strong>Tk_CreateWindow</strong> was used to create a child
window), then event handlers interested in map and unmap events are
invoked immediately. If <em>tkwin</em> is not an internal window, then
the event handlers will be invoked later, after X has seen the request
and returned an event for it.</p>
<p>These procedures should be used in place of the X procedures
<strong>XMapWindow</strong> and <strong>XUnmapWindow</strong>, since
they update Tk's local data structure for <em>tkwin</em>. Applications
using Tk should not invoke <strong>XMapWindow</strong> and
<strong>XUnmapWindow</strong> directly.</p>
