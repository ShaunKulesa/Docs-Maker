<p>Tk_ManageGeometry - arrange to handle geometry requests for a

<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tk.h&gt;

Tk_ManageGeometry(tkwin, mgrPtr, clientData)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Token for window to be managed.</p>
<p>Pointer to data structure containing information about the geometry
manager, or NULL to indicate that <em>tkwin</em>'s geometry should not
be managed anymore. The data structure pointed to by <em>mgrPtr</em>
must be static: Tk keeps a reference to it as long as the window is
managed.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to geometry manager callbacks.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_ManageGeometry</strong> arranges for a particular geometry
manager, described by the <em>mgrPtr</em> argument, to control the
geometry of a particular content window, given by <em>tkwin</em>. If
<em>tkwin</em> was previously managed by some other geometry manager,
the previous manager loses control in favor of the new one. If
<em>mgrPtr</em> is NULL, geometry management is cancelled for
<em>tkwin</em>.</p>
<p>The structure pointed to by <em>mgrPtr</em> contains information
about the geometry manager:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
    const char *name;
    Tk_GeomRequestProc *requestProc;
    Tk_GeomLostSlaveProc *lostSlaveProc;
} Tk_GeomMgr;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>name</em> field is the textual name for the geometry manager,
such as <strong>pack</strong> or <strong>place</strong>; this value will
be returned by the command <strong>winfo manager</strong>.</p>
<p><em>requestProc</em> is a procedure in the geometry manager that will
be invoked whenever <strong>Tk_GeometryRequest</strong> is called by the
content window to change its desired geometry. <em>requestProc</em>
should have arguments and results that match the type
<strong>Tk_GeomRequestProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tk_GeomRequestProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tk_Window tkwin);</code></pre>
<p>The parameters to <em>requestProc</em> will be identical to the
corresponding parameters passed to <strong>Tk_ManageGeometry</strong>.
<em>clientData</em> usually points to a data structure containing
application-specific information about how to manage <em>tkwin</em>'s
geometry.</p>
<p>The <em>lostSlaveProc</em> field of <em>mgrPtr</em> points to another
procedure in the geometry manager. Tk will invoke <em>lostSlaveProc</em>
if some other manager calls <strong>Tk_ManageGeometry</strong> to claim
<em>tkwin</em> away from the current geometry manager.
<em>lostSlaveProc</em> is not invoked if
<strong>Tk_ManageGeometry</strong> is called with a NULL value for
<em>mgrPtr</em> (presumably the current geometry manager has made this
call, so it already knows that the window is no longer managed), nor is
it called if <em>mgrPtr</em> is the same as the window's current
geometry manager. <em>lostSlaveProc</em> should have arguments and
results that match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tk_GeomLostSlaveProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tk_Window tkwin);</code></pre>
<p>The parameters to <em>lostSlaveProc</em> will be identical to the
corresponding parameters passed to
<strong>Tk_ManageGeometry</strong>.</p>
