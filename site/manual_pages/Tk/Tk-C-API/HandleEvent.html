<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong> is a lower-level procedure that deals
with window events. It is called by <strong>Tcl_ServiceEvent</strong>
(and indirectly by <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong>), and in a few other
cases within Tk. It makes callbacks to any window event handlers
(created by calls to <strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong>) that match
<em>eventPtr</em> and then returns. In some cases it may be useful for
an application to bypass the Tk event queue and call
<strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong> directly instead of calling
<strong>Tcl_QueueEvent</strong> followed by
<strong>Tcl_ServiceEvent</strong>.</p>
<p>This procedure may be invoked recursively. For example, it is
possible to invoke <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong> recursively from a
handler called by <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>. This sort of
operation is useful in some modal situations, such as when a notifier
has been popped up and an application wishes to wait for the user to
click a button in the notifier before doing anything else.</p>
