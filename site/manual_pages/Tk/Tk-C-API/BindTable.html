<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter to use when invoking bindings in binding table. Also used
for returning results and errors from binding procedures.</p>
<p>Token for binding table; must have been returned by some previous
call to <strong>Tk_CreateBindingTable</strong>.</p>
<p>Identifies object with which binding is associated.</p>
<p>String describing event sequence.</p>
<p>Tcl script to invoke when binding triggers.</p>
<p>Non-zero means append <em>script</em> to existing script for binding,
if any; zero means replace existing script with new one.</p>
<p>X event to match against bindings in <em>bindingTable</em>.</p>
<p>Identifier for any window on the display where the event occurred.
Used to find display-related information such as key maps.</p>
<p>Number of object identifiers pointed to by <em>objectPtr</em>.</p>
<p>Points to an array of object identifiers: bindings will be considered
for each of these objects in order from first to last.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures provide a general-purpose mechanism for creating and
invoking bindings. Bindings are organized in terms of <em>binding
tables</em>. A binding table consists of a collection of bindings plus a
history of recent events. Within a binding table, bindings are
associated with <em>objects</em>. The meaning of an object is defined by
clients of the binding package. For example, Tk keeps uses one binding
table to hold all of the bindings created by the <strong>bind</strong>
command. For this table, objects are pointers to strings such as window
names, class names, or other binding tags such as <strong>all</strong>.
Tk also keeps a separate binding table for each canvas widget, which
manages bindings created by the canvas's <strong>bind</strong> widget
command; within this table, an object is either a pointer to the
internal structure for a canvas item or a Tk_Uid identifying a tag.</p>
<p>The procedure <strong>Tk_CreateBindingTable</strong> creates a new
binding table and associates <em>interp</em> with it (when bindings in
the table are invoked, the scripts will be evaluated in
<em>interp</em>). <strong>Tk_CreateBindingTable</strong> returns a token
for the table, which must be used in calls to other procedures such as
<strong>Tk_CreateBinding</strong> or <strong>Tk_BindEvent</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteBindingTable</strong> frees all of the state
associated with a binding table. Once it returns the caller should not
use the <em>bindingTable</em> token again.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateBinding</strong> adds a new binding to an existing
table. The <em>object</em> argument identifies the object with which the
binding is to be associated, and it may be any one-word value. Typically
it is a pointer to a string or data structure. The <em>eventString</em>
argument identifies the event or sequence of events for the binding; see
the documentation for the <strong>bind</strong> command for a
description of its format. <em>script</em> is the Tcl script to be
evaluated when the binding triggers. <em>append</em> indicates what to
do if there already exists a binding for <em>object</em> and
<em>eventString</em>: if <em>append</em> is zero then <em>script</em>
replaces the old script; if <em>append</em> is non-zero then the new
script is appended to the old one. <strong>Tk_CreateBinding</strong>
returns an X event mask for all the events associated with the bindings.
This information may be useful to invoke <strong>XSelectInput</strong>
to select relevant events, or to disallow the use of certain events in
bindings. If an error occurred while creating the binding (e.g.,
<em>eventString</em> refers to a non-existent event), then 0 is returned
and an error message is left as the result of interpreter
<em>interp</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteBinding</strong> removes from <em>bindingTable</em>
the binding given by <em>object</em> and <em>eventString</em>, if such a
binding exists. <strong>Tk_DeleteBinding</strong> always returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>. In some cases it may reset the interpreter
result to the default empty value.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_GetBinding</strong> returns a pointer to the script
associated with <em>eventString</em> and <em>object</em> in
<em>bindingTable</em>. If no such binding exists then NULL is returned
and an error message is left as the result of interpreter
<em>interp</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_GetAllBindings</strong> returns in <em>interp</em>'s
result a list of all the event strings for which there are bindings in
<em>bindingTable</em> associated with <em>object</em>. If there are no
bindings for <em>object</em>, the result will be an empty string.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteAllBindings</strong> deletes all of the bindings in
<em>bindingTable</em> that are associated with <em>object</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_BindEvent</strong> is called to process an event. It makes
a copy of the event in an internal history list associated with the
binding table, then it checks for bindings that match the event.
<strong>Tk_BindEvent</strong> processes each of the objects pointed to
by <em>objectPtr</em> in turn. For each object, it finds all the
bindings that match the current event history, selects the most specific
binding using the priority mechanism described in the documentation for
<strong>bind</strong>, and invokes the script for that binding. If there
are no matching bindings for a particular object, then the object is
skipped. <strong>Tk_BindEvent</strong> continues through all of the
objects, handling exceptions such as errors, <strong>break</strong>, and
<strong>continue</strong> as described in the documentation for
<strong>bind</strong>.</p>
