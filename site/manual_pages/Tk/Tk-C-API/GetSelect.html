<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_GetSelection</strong> retrieves the selection specified by
the atom <em>selection</em> in the format specified by <em>target</em>.
The selection may actually be retrieved in several pieces; as each piece
is retrieved, <em>proc</em> is called to process the piece.
<em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tk_GetSelProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_GetSelProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        char *portion);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> and <em>interp</em> parameters to
<em>proc</em> will be copies of the corresponding arguments to
<strong>Tk_GetSelection</strong>. <em>Portion</em> will be a pointer to
a string containing part or all of the selection. For large selections,
<em>proc</em> will be called several times with successive portions of
the selection. The X Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual
allows a selection to be returned in formats other than strings, e.g. as
an array of atoms or integers. If this happens, Tk converts the
selection back into a string before calling <em>proc</em>. If a
selection is returned as an array of atoms, Tk converts it to a string
containing the atom names separated by white space. For any other format
besides string, Tk converts a selection to a string containing
hexadecimal values separated by white space.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_GetSelection</strong> returns to its caller when the
selection has been completely retrieved and processed by <em>proc</em>,
or when a fatal error has occurred (e.g. the selection owner did not
respond promptly). <strong>Tk_GetSelection</strong> normally returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>; if an error occurs, it returns
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> and leaves an error message in interpreter
<em>interp</em>'s result. <em>Proc</em> should also return either
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. If <em>proc</em>
encounters an error in dealing with the selection, it should leave an
error message in the interpreter result and return
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>; this will abort the selection retrieval.</p>
