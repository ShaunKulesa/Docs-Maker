<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateImageType</strong> is invoked to define a new kind
of image. An image type corresponds to a particular value of the
<em>type</em> argument for the <strong>image create</strong> command.
There may exist any number of different image types, and new types may
be defined dynamically by calling <strong>Tk_CreateImageType</strong>.
For example, there might be one type for 2-color bitmaps, another for
multi-color images, another for dithered images, another for video, and
so on.</p>
<p>The code that implements a new image type is called an <em>image
manager</em>. It consists of a collection of procedures plus three
different kinds of data structures. The first data structure is a
Tk_ImageType structure, which contains the name of the image type and
pointers to five procedures provided by the image manager to deal with
images of this type:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tk_ImageType {
    const char *name;
    Tk_ImageCreateProc *createProc;
    Tk_ImageGetProc *getProc;
    Tk_ImageDisplayProc *displayProc;
    Tk_ImageFreeProc *freeProc;
    Tk_ImageDeleteProc *deleteProc;
} Tk_ImageType;</code></pre>
<p>The fields of this structure will be described in later subsections
of this entry.</p>
<p>The second major data structure manipulated by an image manager is
called an <em>image model</em>; it contains overall information about a
particular image, such as the values of the configuration options
specified in an <strong>image create</strong> command. There will
usually be one of these structures for each invocation of the
<strong>image create</strong> command.</p>
<p>The third data structure related to images is an <em>image
instance</em>. There will usually be one of these structures for each
usage of an image in a particular widget. It is possible for a single
image to appear simultaneously in multiple widgets, or even multiple
times in the same widget. Furthermore, different instances may be on
different screens or displays. The image instance data structure
describes things that may vary from instance to instance, such as colors
and graphics contexts for redisplay. There is usually one instance
structure for each <strong>-image</strong> option specified for a widget
or canvas item.</p>
<p>The following subsections describe the fields of a Tk_ImageType in
more detail.</p>
<h2 id="name-1">NAME</h2>
<p><em>typePtr-&gt;name</em> provides a name for the image type. Once
<strong>Tk_CreateImageType</strong> returns, this name may be used in
<strong>image create</strong> commands to create images of the new type.
If there already existed an image type by this name then the new image
type replaces the old one.</p>
<h2 id="createproc">CREATEPROC</h2>
<p><em>typePtr-&gt;createProc</em> provides the address of a procedure
for Tk to call whenever <strong>image create</strong> is invoked to
create an image of the new type. <em>typePtr-&gt;createProc</em> must
match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageCreateProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        const char *name,
        int objc,
        Tcl_Obj *const objv[],
        const Tk_ImageType *typePtr,
        Tk_ImageMaster model,
        ClientData *modelDataPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument is the interpreter in which the
<strong>image</strong> command was invoked, and <em>name</em> is the
name for the new image, which was either specified explicitly in the
<strong>image</strong> command or generated automatically by the
<strong>image</strong> command. The <em>objc</em> and <em>objv</em>
arguments describe all the configuration options for the new image
(everything after the name argument to <strong>image</strong>). The
<em>model</em> argument is a token that refers to Tk's information about
this image; the image manager must return this token to Tk when invoking
the <strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong> procedure. Typically
<em>createProc</em> will parse <em>objc</em> and <em>objv</em> and
create an image model data structure for the new image.
<em>createProc</em> may store an arbitrary one-word value at
*<em>modelDataPtr</em>, which will be passed back to the image manager
when other callbacks are invoked. Typically the value is a pointer to
the model data structure for the image.</p>
<p>If <em>createProc</em> encounters an error, it should leave an error
message in the interpreter result and return <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>;
otherwise it should return <strong>TCL_OK</strong>.</p>
<p><em>createProc</em> should call <strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong> in
order to set the size of the image and request an initial redisplay.</p>
<h2 id="getproc">GETPROC</h2>
<p><em>typePtr-&gt;getProc</em> is invoked by Tk whenever a widget calls
<strong>Tk_GetImage</strong> to use a particular image. This procedure
must match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef ClientData Tk_ImageGetProc(
        Tk_Window tkwin,
        ClientData modelData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>tkwin</em> argument identifies the window in which the image
will be used and <em>modelData</em> is the value returned by
<em>createProc</em> when the image model was created. <em>getProc</em>
will usually create a data structure for the new instance, including
such things as the resources needed to display the image in the given
window. <em>getProc</em> returns a one-word token for the instance,
which is typically the address of the instance data structure. Tk will
pass this value back to the image manager when invoking its
<em>displayProc</em> and <em>freeProc</em> procedures.</p>
<h2 id="displayproc">DISPLAYPROC</h2>
<p><em>typePtr-&gt;displayProc</em> is invoked by Tk whenever an image
needs to be displayed (i.e., whenever a widget calls
<strong>Tk_RedrawImage</strong>). <em>displayProc</em> must match the
following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tk_ImageDisplayProc(
        ClientData instanceData,
        Display *display,
        Drawable drawable,
        int imageX,
        int imageY,
        int width,
        int height,
        int drawableX,
        int drawableY);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>instanceData</em> will be the same as the value returned by
<em>getProc</em> when the instance was created. <em>display</em> and
<em>drawable</em> indicate where to display the image; <em>drawable</em>
may be a pixmap rather than the window specified to <em>getProc</em>
(this is usually the case, since most widgets double-buffer their
redisplay to get smoother visual effects). <em>imageX</em>,
<em>imageY</em>, <em>width</em>, and <em>height</em> identify the region
of the image that must be redisplayed. This region will always be within
the size of the image as specified in the most recent call to
<strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong>. <em>drawableX</em> and
<em>drawableY</em> indicate where in <em>drawable</em> the image should
be displayed; <em>displayProc</em> should display the given region of
the image so that point (<em>imageX</em>, <em>imageY</em>) in the image
appears at (<em>drawableX</em>, <em>drawableY</em>) in
<em>drawable</em>.</p>
<h2 id="freeproc">FREEPROC</h2>
<p><em>typePtr-&gt;freeProc</em> contains the address of a procedure
that Tk will invoke when an image instance is released (i.e., when
<strong>Tk_FreeImage</strong> is invoked). This can happen, for example,
when a widget is deleted or a image item in a canvas is deleted, or when
the image displayed in a widget or canvas item is changed.
<em>freeProc</em> must match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tk_ImageFreeProc(
        ClientData instanceData,
        Display *display);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>instanceData</em> will be the same as the value returned by
<em>getProc</em> when the instance was created, and <em>display</em> is
the display containing the window for the instance. <em>freeProc</em>
should release any resources associated with the image instance, since
the instance will never be used again.</p>
<h2 id="deleteproc">DELETEPROC</h2>
<p><em>typePtr-&gt;deleteProc</em> is a procedure that Tk invokes when
an image is being deleted (i.e.Â when the <strong>image delete</strong>
command is invoked). Before invoking <em>deleteProc</em> Tk will invoke
<em>freeProc</em> for each of the image's instances. <em>deleteProc</em>
must match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tk_ImageDeleteProc(
        ClientData modelData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>modelData</em> argument will be the same as the value stored
in <em>*modelDataPtr</em> by <em>createProc</em> when the image was
created. <em>deleteProc</em> should release any resources associated
with the image.</p>
<h1 id="tk_getimagemodeldata">TK_GETIMAGEMODELDATA</h1>
<p>The procedure <strong>Tk_GetImageMasterData</strong> may be invoked
to retrieve information about an image. For example, an image manager
can use this procedure to locate its image model data for an image. If
there exists an image named <em>name</em> in the interpreter given by
<em>interp</em>, then <em>*typePtrPtr</em> is filled in with type
information for the image (the <em>typePtr</em> value passed to
<strong>Tk_CreateImageType</strong> when the image type was registered)
and the return value is the ClientData value returned by the
<em>createProc</em> when the image was created (this is typically a
pointer to the image model data structure). If no such image exists then
NULL is returned and NULL is stored at <em>*typePtrPtr</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_GetImageModelData</strong> is synonym for
<strong>Tk_GetImageMasterData</strong></p>
<h1 id="legacy-interface-support">LEGACY INTERFACE SUPPORT</h1>
<p>In Tk 8.2 and earlier, the definition of
<strong>Tk_ImageCreateProc</strong> was incompatibly different, with the
following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageCreateProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        char *name,
        int argc,
        char **argv,
        Tk_ImageType *typePtr,
        Tk_ImageMaster model,
        ClientData *modelDataPtr);</code></pre>
<p>Legacy programs and libraries dating from those days may still
contain code that defines extended Tk image types using the old
interface. The Tk header file will still support this legacy interface
if the code is compiled with the macro <strong>USE_OLD_IMAGE</strong>
defined.</p>
<p><em>Tk_ImageModel</em> is synonym for <em>Tk_ImageMaster</em></p>
<p>When the <strong>USE_OLD_IMAGE</strong> legacy support is enabled,
you may see the routine <strong>Tk_InitImageArgs</strong> in use. This
was a migration tool used to create stub-enabled extensions that could
be loaded into interps containing all versions of Tk 8.1 and later. Tk
8.5 no longer provides this routine, but uses a macro to convert any
attempted calls of this routine into an empty comment. Any stub-enabled
extension providing an extended image type via the legacy interface that
is compiled against Tk 8.5 headers and linked against the Tk 8.5 stub
library will produce a file that can be loaded only into interps with Tk
8.5 or later; that is, the normal stub-compatibility rules. If a
developer needs to generate from such code a file that is loadable into
interps with Tk 8.4 or earlier, they must use Tk 8.4 headers and stub
libraries to do so.</p>
<p>Any new code written today should not make use of the legacy
interfaces. Expect their support to go away in Tk 9.</p>
