<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures are called by canvas type managers to perform
various utility functions.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasTkwin</strong> returns the Tk_Window associated with
a particular canvas.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasGetCoord</strong> translates a string specification
of a coordinate (such as <strong>2p</strong> or <strong>1.6c</strong>)
into a double-precision canvas coordinate. If <em>string</em> is a valid
coordinate description then <strong>Tk_CanvasGetCoord</strong> stores
the corresponding canvas coordinate at *<em>doublePtr</em> and returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>. Otherwise it stores an error message in the
interpreter result and returns <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords</strong> is called by type managers
during redisplay to compute where to draw things. Given <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> coordinates in the space of the canvas,
<strong>Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords</strong> computes the corresponding
pixel in the drawable that is currently being used for redisplay; it
returns those coordinates in *<em>drawableXPtr</em> and
*<em>drawableYPtr</em>. This procedure should not be invoked except
during redisplay.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin</strong> is also used during
redisplay. It sets the stipple origin in <em>gc</em> so that stipples
drawn with <em>gc</em> in the current offscreen pixmap will line up with
stipples drawn with origin (0,0) in the canvas's actual window.
<strong>Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin</strong> is needed in order to
guarantee that stipple patterns line up properly when the canvas is
redisplayed in small pieces. Redisplays are carried out in
double-buffered fashion where a piece of the canvas is redrawn in an
offscreen pixmap and then copied back onto the screen. In this approach
the stipple origins in graphics contexts need to be adjusted during each
redisplay to compensate for the position of the off-screen pixmap
relative to the window. If an item is being drawn with stipples, its
type manager typically calls <strong>Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin</strong>
just before using <em>gc</em> to draw something; after it is finished
drawing, the type manager calls <strong>XSetTSOrigin</strong> to restore
the origin in <em>gc</em> back to (0,0) (the restore is needed because
graphics contexts are shared, so they cannot be modified
permanently).</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasWindowCoords</strong> is similar to
<strong>Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords</strong> except that it returns
coordinates in the canvas's window on the screen, instead of coordinates
in an off-screen pixmap.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw</strong> may be invoked by a type
manager to inform Tk that a portion of a canvas needs to be redrawn. The
<em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em> arguments specify
the region that needs to be redrawn, in canvas coordinates. Type
managers rarely need to invoke
<strong>Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw</strong>, since Tk can normally figure
out when an item has changed and make the redisplay request on its
behalf (this happens, for example whenever Tk calls a
<em>configureProc</em> or <em>scaleProc</em>). The only time that a type
manager needs to call <strong>Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw</strong> is if
an item has changed on its own without being invoked through one of the
procedures in its Tk_ItemType; this could happen, for example, in an
image item if the image is modified using image commands.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasTagsParseProc</strong> and
<strong>Tk_CanvasTagsPrintProc</strong> are procedures that handle the
<strong>-tags</strong> option for canvas items. The code of a canvas
type manager will not call these procedures directly, but will use their
addresses to create a <strong>Tk_CustomOption</strong> structure for the
<strong>-tags</strong> option. The code typically looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>static const Tk_CustomOption tagsOption = {Tk_CanvasTagsParseProc,
    Tk_CanvasTagsPrintProc, NULL
};

static const Tk_ConfigSpec configSpecs[] = {
    ...
    {TK_CONFIG_CUSTOM, &quot;-tags&quot;, NULL, NULL,
        NULL, 0, TK_CONFIG_NULL_OK, &amp;tagsOption},
    ...
};</code></pre>
