Tk_Grab(interp, tkwin, grabGlobal)

<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter to use for error reporting</p>
<p>Window on whose behalf the pointer is to be grabbed or released</p>
<p>Boolean indicating whether the grab is global or application
local</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These functions are used to set or release a global or application
local grab. When a grab is set on a particular window in a Tk
application, mouse and keyboard events can only be received by that
window and its descendants. Mouse and keyboard events for windows
outside the tree rooted at <em>tkwin</em> will be redirected to
<em>tkwin</em>. If the grab is global, then all mouse and keyboard
events for windows outside the tree rooted at <em>tkwin</em> (even those
intended for windows in other applications) will be redirected to
<em>tkwin</em>. If the grab is application local, only mouse and
keyboard events intended for a windows within the same application (but
outside the tree rooted at <em>tkwin</em>) will be redirected.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_Grab</strong> sets a grab on a particular window.
<em>Tkwin</em> specifies the window on whose behalf the pointer is to be
grabbed. <em>GrabGlobal</em> indicates whether the grab should be global
or application local; if it is non-zero, it means the grab should be
global. Normally, <strong>Tk_Grab</strong> returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>; if an error occurs and the grab cannot be set,
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and an error message is left if
<em>interp</em>'s result. Once this call completes successfully, no
window outside the tree rooted at <em>tkwin</em> will receive pointer-
or keyboard-related events until the next call to Tk_Ungrab. If a
previous grab was in effect within the application, then it is replaced
with a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_Ungrab</strong> releases a grab on the mouse pointer and
keyboard, if there is one set on the window given by <em>tkwin</em>.
Once a grab is released, pointer and keyboard events will start being
delivered to other windows again.</p>
