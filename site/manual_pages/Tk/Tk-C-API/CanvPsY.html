<p>A token that identifies a canvas widget for which Postscript is being
generated.</p>
<p>Y-coordinate in the space of the canvas.</p>
<p>A Tcl interpreter; Postscript is appended to its result, or the
result may be replaced with an error message.</p>
<p>Bitmap to use for generating Postscript.</p>
<p>X-coordinate within <em>bitmap</em> of left edge of region to
output.</p>
<p>Y-coordinate within <em>bitmap</em> of top edge of region to
output.</p>
<p>Width of region of bitmap to output, in pixels.</p>
<p>Height of region of bitmap to output, in pixels.</p>
<p>Information about color value to set in Postscript.</p>
<p>Font for which Postscript is to be generated.</p>
<p>Pointer to an array of coordinates for one or more points specified
in canvas coordinates. The order of values in <em>coordPtr</em> is x1,
y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, and so on.</p>
<p>Number of points at <em>coordPtr</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures are called by canvas type managers to carry out
common functions related to generating Postscript. Most of the
procedures take a <em>canvas</em> argument, which refers to a canvas
widget for which Postscript is being generated.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasPsY</strong> takes as argument a y-coordinate in the
space of a canvas and returns the value that should be used for that
point in the Postscript currently being generated for <em>canvas</em>. Y
coordinates require transformation because Postscript uses an origin at
the lower-left corner whereas X uses an origin at the upper-left corner.
Canvas x coordinates can be used directly in Postscript without
transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasPsBitmap</strong> generates Postscript to describe a
region of a bitmap. The Postscript is generated in proper image data
format for Postscript, i.e., as data between angle brackets, one bit per
pixel. The Postscript is appended to the result of interpreter
<em>interp</em> and <strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned unless an error
occurs, in which case <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and the
interpreter result is overwritten with an error message.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasPsColor</strong> generates Postscript to set the
current color to correspond to its <em>colorPtr</em> argument, taking
into account any color map specified in the <strong>postscript</strong>
command. It appends the Postscript to the interpreter <em>interp</em>'s
result and returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong> unless an error occurs, in
which case <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and the interpreter's
result is overwritten with an error message.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasPsFont</strong> generates Postscript that sets the
current font to match <em>tkFont</em> as closely as possible.
<strong>Tk_CanvasPsFont</strong> takes into account any font map
specified in the <strong>postscript</strong> command, and it does the
best it can at mapping X fonts to Postscript fonts. It appends the
Postscript to interpreter <em>interp</em>'s result and returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> unless an error occurs, in which case
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and the interpreter's result is
overwritten with an error message.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasPsPath</strong> generates Postscript to set the
current path to the set of points given by <em>coordPtr</em> and
<em>numPoints</em>. It appends the resulting Postscript to the result of
interpreter <em>interp</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_CanvasPsStipple</strong> generates Postscript that will
fill the current path in stippled fashion. It uses <em>bitmap</em> as
the stipple pattern and the current Postscript color; ones in the
stipple bitmap are drawn in the current color, and zeroes are not drawn
at all. The Postscript is appended to interpreter <em>interp</em>'s
result and <strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned, unless an error occurs,
in which case <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and the
interpreter's result is overwritten with an error message.</p>
