<p>Window for which <em>proc</em> will provide selection
information.</p>
<p>The name of the selection for which <em>proc</em> will provide
selection information.</p>
<p>Form in which <em>proc</em> can provide the selection (e.g. STRING or
FILE_NAME). Corresponds to <em>type</em> arguments in
<strong>selection</strong> commands.</p>
<p>Procedure to invoke whenever the selection is owned by <em>tkwin</em>
and the selection contents are requested in the format given by
<em>target</em>.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<p>If the selection requestor is not in this process, <em>format</em>
determines the representation used to transmit the selection to its
requestor.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateSelHandler</strong> arranges for a particular
procedure (<em>proc</em>) to be called whenever <em>selection</em> is
owned by <em>tkwin</em> and the selection contents are requested in the
form given by <em>target</em>. <em>Target</em> should be one of the
entries defined in the left column of Table 2 of the X Inter-Client
Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM) or any other form in which an
application is willing to present the selection. The most common form is
STRING.</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tk_SelectionProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_SelectionProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        int offset,
        char *buffer,
        int maxBytes);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to
<strong>Tk_CreateSelHandler</strong>. Typically, <em>clientData</em>
points to a data structure containing application-specific information
that is needed to retrieve the selection. <em>Offset</em> specifies an
offset position into the selection, <em>buffer</em> specifies a location
at which to copy information about the selection, and <em>maxBytes</em>
specifies the amount of space available at <em>buffer</em>.
<em>Proc</em> should place a NULL-terminated string at <em>buffer</em>
containing <em>maxBytes</em> or fewer characters (not including the
terminating NULL), and it should return a count of the number of
non-NULL characters stored at <em>buffer</em>. If the selection no
longer exists (e.g. it once existed but the user deleted the range of
characters containing it), then <em>proc</em> should return -1.</p>
<p>When transferring large selections, Tk will break them up into
smaller pieces (typically a few thousand bytes each) for more efficient
transmission. It will do this by calling <em>proc</em> one or more
times, using successively higher values of <em>offset</em> to retrieve
successive portions of the selection. If <em>proc</em> returns a count
less than <em>maxBytes</em> it means that the entire remainder of the
selection has been returned. If <em>proc</em>'s return value is
<em>maxBytes</em> it means there may be additional information in the
selection, so Tk must make another call to <em>proc</em> to retrieve the
next portion.</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> always returns selection information in the form of a
character string. However, the ICCCM allows for information to be
transmitted from the selection owner to the selection requestor in any
of several formats, such as a string, an array of atoms, an array of
integers, etc. The <em>format</em> argument to
<strong>Tk_CreateSelHandler</strong> indicates what format should be
used to transmit the selection to its requestor (see the middle column
of Table 2 of the ICCCM for examples). If <em>format</em> is not STRING,
then Tk will take the value returned by <em>proc</em> and divided it
into fields separated by white space. If <em>format</em> is ATOM, then
Tk will return the selection as an array of atoms, with each field in
<em>proc</em>'s result treated as the name of one atom. For any other
value of <em>format</em>, Tk will return the selection as an array of
32-bit values where each field of <em>proc</em>'s result is treated as a
number and translated to a 32-bit value. In any event, the
<em>format</em> atom is returned to the selection requestor along with
the contents of the selection.</p>
<p>If <strong>Tk_CreateSelHandler</strong> is called when there already
exists a handler for <em>selection</em> and <em>target</em> on
<em>tkwin</em>, then the existing handler is replaced with a new
one.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteSelHandler</strong> removes the handler given by
<em>tkwin</em>, <em>selection</em>, and <em>target</em>, if such a
handler exists. If there is no such handler then it has no effect.</p>
