<p>Structure that defines the new file format.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat</strong> is invoked to define a new
file format for image data for use with photo images. The code that
implements an image file format is called an image file format handler,
or handler for short. The photo image code maintains a list of handlers
that can be used to read and write data to or from a file. Some handlers
may also support reading image data from a string or converting image
data to a string format. The user can specify which handler to use with
the <strong>-format</strong> image configuration option or the
<strong>-format</strong> option to the <strong>read</strong> and
<strong>write</strong> photo image subcommands.</p>
<p>An image file format handler consists of a collection of procedures
plus a Tk_PhotoImageFormat structure, which contains the name of the
image file format and pointers to six procedures provided by the handler
to deal with files and strings in this format. The Tk_PhotoImageFormat
structure contains the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tk_PhotoImageFormat {
    const char *name;
    Tk_ImageFileMatchProc *fileMatchProc;
    Tk_ImageStringMatchProc *stringMatchProc;
    Tk_ImageFileReadProc *fileReadProc;
    Tk_ImageStringReadProc *stringReadProc;
    Tk_ImageFileWriteProc *fileWriteProc;
    Tk_ImageStringWriteProc *stringWriteProc;
} Tk_PhotoImageFormat;</code></pre>
<p>The handler need not provide implementations of all six procedures.
For example, the procedures that handle string data would not be
provided for a format in which the image data are stored in binary, and
could therefore contain null characters. If any procedure is not
implemented, the corresponding pointer in the Tk_PhotoImageFormat
structure should be set to NULL. The handler must provide the
<em>fileMatchProc</em> procedure if it provides the
<em>fileReadProc</em> procedure, and the <em>stringMatchProc</em>
procedure if it provides the <em>stringReadProc</em> procedure.</p>
<h2 id="name-1">NAME</h2>
<p><em>formatPtr-&gt;name</em> provides a name for the image type. Once
<strong>Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat</strong> returns, this name may be
used in the <strong>-format</strong> photo image configuration and
subcommand option. The manual page for the photo image (photo(n))
describes how image file formats are chosen based on their names and the
value given to the <strong>-format</strong> option. The first character
of <em>formatPtr-&gt;name</em> must not be an uppercase character from
the ASCII character set (that is, one of the characters
<strong>A</strong>-<strong>Z</strong>). Such names are used only for
legacy interface support (see below).</p>
<h2 id="filematchproc">FILEMATCHPROC</h2>
<p><em>formatPtr-&gt;fileMatchProc</em> provides the address of a
procedure for Tk to call when it is searching for an image file format
handler suitable for reading data in a given file.
<em>formatPtr-&gt;fileMatchProc</em> must match the following
prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageFileMatchProc(
        Tcl_Channel chan,
        const char *fileName,
        Tcl_Obj *format,
        int *widthPtr,
        int *heightPtr,
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>fileName</em> argument is the name of the file containing the
image data, which is open for reading as <em>chan</em>. The
<em>format</em> argument contains the value given for the
<strong>-format</strong> option, or NULL if the option was not
specified. If the data in the file appears to be in the format supported
by this handler, the <em>formatPtr-&gt;fileMatchProc</em> procedure
should store the width and height of the image in *<em>widthPtr</em> and
*<em>heightPtr</em> respectively, and return 1. Otherwise it should
return 0.</p>
<h2 id="stringmatchproc">STRINGMATCHPROC</h2>
<p><em>formatPtr-&gt;stringMatchProc</em> provides the address of a
procedure for Tk to call when it is searching for an image file format
handler for suitable for reading data from a given string.
<em>formatPtr-&gt;stringMatchProc</em> must match the following
prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageStringMatchProc(
        Tcl_Obj *data,
        Tcl_Obj *format,
        int *widthPtr,
        int *heightPtr,
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>data</em> argument points to the object containing the image
data. The <em>format</em> argument contains the value given for the
<strong>-format</strong> option, or NULL if the option was not
specified. If the data in the string appears to be in the format
supported by this handler, the <em>formatPtr-&gt;stringMatchProc</em>
procedure should store the width and height of the image in
*<em>widthPtr</em> and *<em>heightPtr</em> respectively, and return 1.
Otherwise it should return 0.</p>
<h2 id="filereadproc">FILEREADPROC</h2>
<p><em>formatPtr-&gt;fileReadProc</em> provides the address of a
procedure for Tk to call to read data from an image file into a photo
image. <em>formatPtr-&gt;fileReadProc</em> must match the following
prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageFileReadProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Channel chan,
        const char *fileName,
        Tcl_Obj *format,
        PhotoHandle imageHandle,
        int destX, int destY,
        int width, int height,
        int srcX, int srcY);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument is the interpreter in which the command
was invoked to read the image; it should be used for reporting errors.
The image data is in the file named <em>fileName</em>, which is open for
reading as <em>chan</em>. The <em>format</em> argument contains the
value given for the <strong>-format</strong> option, or NULL if the
option was not specified. The image data in the file, or a subimage of
it, is to be read into the photo image identified by the handle
<em>imageHandle</em>. The subimage of the data in the file is of
dimensions <em>width</em> x <em>height</em> and has its top-left corner
at coordinates (<em>srcX</em>,<em>srcY</em>). It is to be stored in the
photo image with its top-left corner at coordinates
(<em>destX</em>,<em>destY</em>) using the
<strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> procedure. The return value is a
standard Tcl return value.</p>
<h2 id="stringreadproc">STRINGREADPROC</h2>
<p><em>formatPtr-&gt;stringReadProc</em> provides the address of a
procedure for Tk to call to read data from a string into a photo image.
<em>formatPtr-&gt;stringReadProc</em> must match the following
prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageStringReadProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Obj *data,
        Tcl_Obj *format,
        PhotoHandle imageHandle,
        int destX, int destY,
        int width, int height,
        int srcX, int srcY);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument is the interpreter in which the command
was invoked to read the image; it should be used for reporting errors.
The <em>data</em> argument points to the image data in object form. The
<em>format</em> argument contains the value given for the
<strong>-format</strong> option, or NULL if the option was not
specified. The image data in the string, or a subimage of it, is to be
read into the photo image identified by the handle <em>imageHandle</em>.
The subimage of the data in the string is of dimensions <em>width</em> x
<em>height</em> and has its top-left corner at coordinates
(<em>srcX</em>,<em>srcY</em>). It is to be stored in the photo image
with its top-left corner at coordinates (<em>destX</em>,<em>destY</em>)
using the <strong>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</strong> procedure. The return value
is a standard Tcl return value.</p>
<h2 id="filewriteproc">FILEWRITEPROC</h2>
<p><em>formatPtr-&gt;fileWriteProc</em> provides the address of a
procedure for Tk to call to write data from a photo image to a file.
<em>formatPtr-&gt;fileWriteProc</em> must match the following
prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageFileWriteProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        const char *fileName,
        Tcl_Obj *format,
        Tk_PhotoImageBlock *blockPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument is the interpreter in which the command
was invoked to write the image; it should be used for reporting errors.
The image data to be written are in memory and are described by the
Tk_PhotoImageBlock structure pointed to by <em>blockPtr</em>; see the
manual page FindPhoto(3) for details. The <em>fileName</em> argument
points to the string giving the name of the file in which to write the
image data. The <em>format</em> argument contains the value given for
the <strong>-format</strong> option, or NULL if the option was not
specified. The format string can contain extra characters after the name
of the format. If appropriate, the <em>formatPtr-&gt;fileWriteProc</em>
procedure may interpret these characters to specify further details
about the image file. The return value is a standard Tcl return
value.</p>
<h2 id="stringwriteproc">STRINGWRITEPROC</h2>
<p><em>formatPtr-&gt;stringWriteProc</em> provides the address of a
procedure for Tk to call to translate image data from a photo image into
a string. <em>formatPtr-&gt;stringWriteProc</em> must match the
following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ImageStringWriteProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Obj *format,
        Tk_PhotoImageBlock *blockPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument is the interpreter in which the command
was invoked to convert the image; it should be used for reporting
errors. The image data to be converted are in memory and are described
by the Tk_PhotoImageBlock structure pointed to by <em>blockPtr</em>; see
the manual page FindPhoto(3) for details. The data for the string should
be put in the interpreter <em>interp</em> result. The <em>format</em>
argument contains the value given for the <strong>-format</strong>
option, or NULL if the option was not specified. The format string can
contain extra characters after the name of the format. If appropriate,
the <em>formatPtr-&gt;stringWriteProc</em> procedure may interpret these
characters to specify further details about the image file. The return
value is a standard Tcl return value.</p>
<h1 id="legacy-interface-support">LEGACY INTERFACE SUPPORT</h1>
<p>In Tk 8.2 and earlier, the definition of all the function pointer
types stored in fields of a <strong>Tk_PhotoImageFormat</strong> struct
were incompatibly different. Legacy programs and libraries dating from
those days may still contain code that defines extended Tk photo image
formats using the old interface. The Tk header file will still support
this legacy interface if the code is compiled with the macro
<strong>USE_OLD_IMAGE</strong> defined. Alternatively, the legacy
interfaces are used if the first character of
<em>formatPtr-&gt;name</em> is an uppercase ASCII character
(<strong>A</strong>-<strong>Z</strong>), and explicit casts are used to
forgive the type mismatch. For example,</p>
<pre><code>static Tk_PhotoImageFormat myFormat = {
    &quot;MyFormat&quot;,
    (Tk_ImageFileMatchProc *) FileMatch,
    NULL,
    (Tk_ImageFileReadProc *) FileRead,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL
};</code></pre>
<p>would define a minimal <strong>Tk_PhotoImageFormat</strong> that
operates provide only file reading capability, where
<strong>FileMatch</strong> and <strong>FileRead</strong> are written
according to the legacy interfaces of Tk 8.2 or earlier.</p>
<p>Any stub-enabled extension providing an extended photo image format
via the legacy interface enabled by the <strong>USE_OLD_IMAGE</strong>
macro that is compiled against Tk 8.5 headers and linked against the Tk
8.5 stub library will produce a file that can be loaded only into
interps with Tk 8.5 or later; that is, the normal stub-compatibility
rules. If a developer needs to generate from such code a file that is
loadable into interps with Tk 8.4 or earlier, they must use Tk 8.4
headers and stub libraries to do so.</p>
<p>Any new code written today should not make use of the legacy
interfaces. Expect their support to go away in Tk 9.</p>
