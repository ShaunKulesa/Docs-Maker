<p>Procedure to invoke whenever a ClientMessage X event occurs on any
display.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler</strong> arranges for
<em>proc</em> to be invoked in the future whenever a ClientMessage X
event occurs that is not handled by <strong>WM_PROTOCOL</strong>.
<strong>Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler</strong> is intended for use by
applications which need to watch X ClientMessage events, such as drag
and drop applications.</p>
<p>The callback to <em>proc</em> will be made by
<strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>; this mechanism only works in programs
that dispatch events through <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong> (or through
other Tk procedures that call <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>, such as
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or <strong>Tk_MainLoop</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tk_ClientMessageProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ClientMessageProc(
        Tk_Window tkwin,
        XEvent *eventPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>tkwin</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is the Tk window which
is associated with this event. <em>EventPtr</em> is a pointer to the X
event.</p>
<p>Whenever an X ClientMessage event is processed by
<strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>, the <em>proc</em> is called if it was
not handled as a <strong>WM_PROTOCOL</strong>. The return value from
<em>proc</em> is normally 0. A non-zero return value indicates that the
event is not to be handled further; that is, <em>proc</em> has done all
processing that is to be allowed for the event.</p>
<p>If there are multiple ClientMessage event handlers, each one is
called for each event, in the order in which they were established.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler</strong> may be called to
delete a previously-created ClientMessage event handler: it deletes each
handler it finds that matches the <em>proc</em> argument. If no such
handler exists, then <strong>Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler</strong>
returns without doing anything. Although Tk supports it, it's probably a
bad idea to have more than one callback with the same <em>proc</em>
argument.</p>
