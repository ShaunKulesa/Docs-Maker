<p>Procedure to invoke whenever any X event occurs on any display.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</strong> arranges for <em>proc</em>
to be invoked in the future whenever any X event occurs. This mechanism
is <em>not</em> intended for dispatching X events on windows managed by
Tk (you should use <strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong> for this
purpose). <strong>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</strong> is intended for other
purposes, such as tracing X events, monitoring events on windows not
owned by Tk, accessing X-related libraries that were not originally
designed for use with Tk, and so on.</p>
<p>The callback to <em>proc</em> will be made by
<strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>; this mechanism only works in programs
that dispatch events through <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong> (or through
other Tk procedures that call <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>, such as
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or <strong>Tk_MainLoop</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tk_GenericProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_GenericProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        XEvent *eventPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to
<strong>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</strong> when the callback was created.
Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to a data structure containing
application-specific information about how to handle events.
<em>EventPtr</em> is a pointer to the X event.</p>
<p>Whenever an X event is processed by <strong>Tk_HandleEvent</strong>,
<em>proc</em> is called. The return value from <em>proc</em> is normally
0. A non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be handled
further; that is, <em>proc</em> has done all processing that is to be
allowed for the event.</p>
<p>If there are multiple generic event handlers, each one is called for
each event, in the order in which they were established.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</strong> may be called to delete a
previously-created generic event handler: it deletes each handler it
finds that matches the <em>proc</em> and <em>clientData</em> arguments.
If no such handler exists, then <strong>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</strong>
returns without doing anything. Although Tk supports it, it's probably a
bad idea to have more than one callback with the same <em>proc</em> and
<em>clientData</em> arguments.</p>
<p>Establishing a generic event handler does nothing to ensure that the
process will actually receive the X events that the handler wants to
process. For example, it is the caller's responsibility to invoke
<strong>XSelectInput</strong> to select the desired events, if that is
necessary.</p>
