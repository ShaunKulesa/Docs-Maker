Tk_ImageChanged(model, x, y, width, height, imageWidth, imageHeight)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Token for image, which was passed to image's <em>createProc</em> when
the image was created.</p>
<p>X-coordinate of upper-left corner of region that needs redisplay
(measured from upper-left corner of image).</p>
<p>Y-coordinate of upper-left corner of region that needs redisplay
(measured from upper-left corner of image).</p>
<p>Width of region that needs to be redrawn, in pixels.</p>
<p>Height of region that needs to be redrawn, in pixels.</p>
<p>Current width of image, in pixels.</p>
<p>Current height of image, in pixels.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>An image manager calls <strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong> for an image
whenever anything happens that requires the image to be redrawn. As a
result of calling <strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong>, any widgets using
the image are notified so that they can redisplay themselves
appropriately. The <em>model</em> argument identifies the image, and
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>width</em>, and <em>height</em> specify a
rectangular region within the image that needs to be redrawn.
<em>imageWidth</em> and <em>imageHeight</em> specify the image's (new)
size.</p>
<p><em>Tk_ImageModel</em> is synonym for <em>Tk_ImageMaster</em></p>
<p>An image manager should call <strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong> during
its <em>createProc</em> to specify the image's initial size and to force
redisplay if there are existing instances for the image. If any of the
pixel values in the image should change later on,
<strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong> should be called again with <em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>, <em>width</em>, and <em>height</em> values that cover all
the pixels that changed. If the size of the image should change, then
<strong>Tk_ImageChanged</strong> must be called to indicate the new
size, even if no pixels need to be redisplayed.</p>
