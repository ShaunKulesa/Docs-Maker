<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tk_CreateErrorHandler</strong> arranges for a particular
procedure (<em>proc</em>) to be called whenever certain protocol errors
occur on a particular display (<em>display</em>). Protocol errors occur
when the X protocol is used incorrectly, such as attempting to map a
window that does not exist. See the Xlib documentation for
<strong>XSetErrorHandler</strong> for more information on the kinds of
errors that can occur. For <em>proc</em> to be invoked to handle a
particular error, five things must occur:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The error must pertain to <em>display</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Either the <em>error</em> argument to
<strong>Tk_CreateErrorHandler</strong> must have been -1, or the
<em>error</em> argument must match the <em>error_code</em> field from
the error event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Either the <em>request</em> argument to
<strong>Tk_CreateErrorHandler</strong> must have been -1, or the
<em>request</em> argument must match the <em>request_code</em> field
from the error event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Either the <em>minor</em> argument to
<strong>Tk_CreateErrorHandler</strong> must have been -1, or the
<em>minor</em> argument must match the <em>minor_code</em> field from
the error event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The protocol request to which the error pertains must have been made
when the handler was active (see below for more information).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the
following type:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tk_ErrorProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        XErrorEvent *errEventPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to
<strong>Tcl_CreateErrorHandler</strong> when the callback was created.
Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to a data structure containing
application-specific information that is needed to deal with the error.
<em>ErrEventPtr</em> is a pointer to the X error event. The procedure
<em>proc</em> should return an integer value. If it returns 0 it means
that <em>proc</em> handled the error completely and there is no need to
take any other action for the error. If it returns non-zero it means
<em>proc</em> was unable to handle the error.</p>
<p>If a value of NULL is specified for <em>proc</em>, all matching
errors will be ignored: this will produce the same result as if a
procedure had been specified that always returns 0.</p>
<p>If more than more than one handler matches a particular error, then
they are invoked in turn. The handlers will be invoked in reverse order
of creation: most recently declared handler first. If any handler
returns 0, then subsequent (older) handlers will not be invoked. If no
handler returns 0, then Tk invokes X's default error handler, which
prints an error message and aborts the program. If you wish to have a
default handler that deals with errors that no other handler can deal
with, then declare it first.</p>
<p>The X documentation states that This restriction applies to handlers
declared by <strong>Tk_CreateErrorHandler</strong>; disobey it at your
own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler</strong> may be called to delete a
previously-created error handler. The <em>handler</em> argument
identifies the error handler, and should be a value returned by a
previous call to <strong>Tk_CreateEventHandler</strong>.</p>
<p>A particular error handler applies to errors resulting from protocol
requests generated between the call to
<strong>Tk_CreateErrorHandler</strong> and the call to
<strong>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler</strong>. However, the actual callback to
<em>proc</em> may not occur until after the
<strong>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler</strong> call, due to buffering in the
client and server. If an error event pertains to a protocol request made
just before calling <strong>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler</strong>, then the
error event may not have been processed before the
<strong>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler</strong> call. When this situation arises,
Tk will save information about the handler and invoke the handler's
<em>proc</em> later when the error event finally arrives. If an
application wishes to delete an error handler and know for certain that
all relevant errors have been processed, it should first call
<strong>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler</strong> and then call
<strong>XSync</strong>; this will flush out any buffered requests and
errors, but will result in a performance penalty because it requires
communication to and from the X server. After the <strong>XSync</strong>
call Tk is guaranteed not to call any error handlers deleted before the
<strong>XSync</strong> call.</p>
<p>For the Tk error handling mechanism to work properly, it is essential
that application code never calls <strong>XSetErrorHandler</strong>
directly; applications should use only
<strong>Tk_CreateErrorHandler</strong>.</p>
