<dt>-use id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the main window for the application is to be embedded
in the window whose identifier is <em>id</em>, instead of being created
as an independent toplevel window. <em>Id</em> must be specified in the
same way as the value for the <strong>-use</strong> option for toplevel
widgets (i.e. it has a form like that returned by the <strong>winfo
id</strong> command).</p>
<p>Note that on some platforms this will only work correctly if
<em>id</em> refers to a Tk <strong>frame</strong> or
<strong>toplevel</strong> that has its <strong>-container</strong>
option enabled.</p>

<p>Specifies the visual to use for the window. <em>Visual</em> may have
any of the forms supported by the <strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong>
procedure.</p>

<dd>
<p>Pass all remaining arguments through to the script's

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Wish</strong> is a simple program consisting of the Tcl
command language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands
from standard input or from a file. It creates a main window and then
processes Tcl commands. If <strong>wish</strong> is invoked with
arguments, then the first few arguments, ?<strong>-encoding</strong>
<em>name</em>? ?<em>fileName</em>?, specify the name of a script file,
and, optionally, the encoding of the text data stored in that script
file. A value for <em>fileName</em> is recognized if the appropriate
argument does not start with</p>
<p>If there are no arguments, or the arguments do not specify a
<em>fileName</em>, then wish reads Tcl commands interactively from
standard input. It will continue processing commands until all windows
have been deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input. If
there exists a file in the home directory of the user,
<strong>wish</strong> evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before
reading the first command from standard input.</p>
<p>If arguments to <strong>wish</strong> do specify a <em>fileName</em>,
then <em>fileName</em> is treated as the name of a script file.
<strong>Wish</strong> will evaluate the script in <em>fileName</em>
(which presumably creates a user interface), then it will respond to
events until all windows have been deleted. Commands will not be read
from standard input. There is no automatic evaluation of when the name
of a script file is presented on the <strong>wish</strong> command line,
but the script file can always <strong>source</strong> it if
desired.</p>
<p>Note that on Windows, the
<strong>wish</strong><em>version</em><strong>.exe</strong> program
varies from the
<strong>tclsh</strong><em>version</em><strong>.exe</strong> program in
an additional important way: it does not connect to a standard Windows
console and is instead a windowed program. Because of this, it
additionally provides access to its own <strong>console</strong>
command.</p>
<h1 id="option-processing">OPTION PROCESSING</h1>
<p><strong>Wish</strong> automatically processes all of the command-line
options described in the <strong>OPTIONS</strong> summary above. Any
other command-line arguments besides these are passed through to the
application using the <strong>argc</strong> and <strong>argv</strong>
variables described later.</p>
<h1 id="application-name-and-class">APPLICATION NAME AND CLASS</h1>
<p>The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as
<strong>send</strong> commands, is taken from the <strong>-name</strong>
option, if it is specified; otherwise it is taken from
<em>fileName</em>, if it is specified, or from the command name by which
<strong>wish</strong> was invoked. In the last two cases, if the name
contains a character, then only the characters after the last slash are
used as the application name.</p>
<p>The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as
specifying options with a <strong>RESOURCE_MANAGER</strong> property or
.Xdefaults file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
capitalized.</p>
<h1 id="variables">VARIABLES</h1>
<p><strong>Wish</strong> sets the following Tcl variables:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>argc</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains a count of the number of <em>arg</em> arguments (0 if none),
not including the options described above.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>argv</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the <em>arg</em> arguments
that follow a <strong>- -</strong> option or do not match any of the
options described in <strong>OPTIONS</strong> above, in order, or an
empty string if there are no such arguments.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>argv0</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains <em>fileName</em> if it was specified. Otherwise, contains
the name by which <strong>wish</strong> was invoked.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>geometry</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the <strong>-geometry</strong> option is specified,
<strong>wish</strong> copies its value into this variable. If the
variable still exists after <em>fileName</em> has been evaluated,
<strong>wish</strong> uses the value of the variable in a <strong>wm
geometry</strong> command to set the main window's geometry.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tcl_interactive</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains 1 if <strong>wish</strong> is reading commands interactively
(<em>fileName</em> was not specified and standard input is a
terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="script-files">SCRIPT FILES</h1>
<p>If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/wish</code></pre>
<p>then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you
mark it as executable. This assumes that <strong>wish</strong> has been
installed in the default location in /usr/local/bin; if it is installed
somewhere else then you will have to modify the above line to match.
Many UNIX systems do not allow the <strong>#!</strong> line to exceed
about 30 characters in length, so be sure that the <strong>wish</strong>
executable can be accessed with a short file name.</p>
<p>An even better approach is to start your script files with the
following three lines:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \
exec wish &quot;$0&quot; ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous
paragraph. First, the location of the <strong>wish</strong> binary does
not have to be hard-wired into the script: it can be anywhere in your
shell search path. Second, it gets around the 30-character file name
limit in the previous approach. Third, this approach will work even if
<strong>wish</strong> is itself a shell script (this is done on some
systems in order to handle multiple architectures or operating systems:
the <strong>wish</strong> script selects one of several binaries to
run). The three lines cause both <strong>sh</strong> and
<strong>wish</strong> to process the script, but the
<strong>exec</strong> is only executed by <strong>sh</strong>.
<strong>sh</strong> processes the script first; it treats the second
line as a comment and executes the third line. The <strong>exec</strong>
statement cause the shell to stop processing and instead to start up
<strong>wish</strong> to reprocess the entire script. When
<strong>wish</strong> starts up, it treats all three lines as comments,
since the backslash at the end of the second line causes the third line
to be treated as part of the comment on the second line.</p>
<p>The end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end of
the medium, or by the character, If this character is present in the
file, the <strong>wish</strong> application will read text up to but not
including the character. An application that requires this character in
the file may encode it as or or may generate it by use of commands such
as <strong>format</strong> or <strong>binary</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="prompts">PROMPTS</h1>
<p>When <strong>wish</strong> is invoked interactively it normally
prompts for each command with You can change the prompt by setting the
variables <strong>tcl_prompt1</strong> and <strong>tcl_prompt2</strong>.
If variable <strong>tcl_prompt1</strong> exists then it must consist of
a Tcl script to output a prompt; instead of outputting a prompt
<strong>wish</strong> will evaluate the script in
<strong>tcl_prompt1</strong>. The variable <strong>tcl_prompt2</strong>
is used in a similar way when a newline is typed but the current command
is not yet complete; if <strong>tcl_prompt2</strong> is not set then no
prompt is output for incomplete commands.</p>
