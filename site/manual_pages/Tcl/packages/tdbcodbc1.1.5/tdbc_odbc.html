<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>tdbc::odbc</strong> driver provides a database interface
that conforms to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl
script to connect to any SQL database presenting an ODBC interface. It
is also provided as a worked example of how to write a database driver
in C, so that driver authors have a starting point for further
development.</p>
<p>Connection to an ODBC database is established by invoking
<strong>tdbc::odbc::connection create</strong>, passing it the name to
be used as a connection handle, followed by a standard ODBC connection
string. As an alternative, <strong>tdbc::odbc::connection new</strong>
may be used to create a database connection with an automatically
assigned name. The return value from <strong>tdbc::odbc::connection
new</strong> is the name that was chosen for the connection handle.</p>
<p>The connection string will include at least a <strong>DRIVER</strong>
or <strong>DSN</strong> keyword, and may include others that are defined
by a particular ODBC driver. (If the local ODBC system supports a
graphical user interface, the <strong>-parent</strong> option (see
below) may allow calling <strong>tdbc::odbc::connection create</strong>
with an empty connection string.)</p>
<p>The side effect of <strong>tdbc::odbc::connection create</strong> is
to create a new database connection.. See
<strong>tdbc::connection(n)</strong> for the details of how to use the
connection to manipulate a database.</p>
<p>In addition to a standard TDBC interface, <strong>tdbc::odbc</strong>
supports three additional ccommands. The first of these,
<strong>tdbc::odbc::datasources</strong>, which returns a Tcl list
enumerating the named data sources available to the program (for
connection with the <strong>DSN</strong> keyword in the connection
string). The result of <strong>tdbc::odbc::datasources</strong> may be
constrained to only system data sources or only user data sources by
including the <strong>-system</strong> or <strong>-user</strong>
options, respectively.</p>
<p>The <strong>tdbc::odbc::drivers</strong> command returns a dictionary
whose keys are the names of drivers available for the
<strong>DRIVER</strong> keyword in the connection string, and whose
values are descriptions of the drivers.</p>
<p>The <strong>tdbc::odbc::datasource</strong> command allows
configuration of named data sources on those systems that support the
ODBC Installer application programming interface. It accepts a
<em>command</em>, which specifies the operation to be performed, the
name of a <em>driver</em> for the database in question, and a set of
keyword-value pairs that are interpreted by the given driver. The
<em>command</em> must be one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>add</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds a user data source. The keyword-value pairs must include at
least a <strong>DSN</strong> option naming the data source</p>
</dd>
<dt>add_system</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds a system data source. The keyword-value pairs must include at
least a <strong>DSN</strong> option naming the data source</p>
</dd>
<dt>configure</dt>
<dd>
<p>Configures a user data source. The keyword-value pairs will usually
include a <strong>DSN</strong> option naming the data source. Some
drivers will support other options, such as the
<strong>CREATE_DB</strong> option to the Microsoft Access driver on
Windows.</p>
</dd>
<dt>configure_system</dt>
<dd>
<p>Configures a system data source.</p>
</dd>
<dt>remove</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes a user data source. The keyword-value pairs must include a
<strong>DSN</strong> option specifying the data source to remove.</p>
</dd>
<dt>remove_system</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes a system data source. The keyword-value pairs must include a
<strong>DSN</strong> option specifying the data source to remove.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="connection-options">CONNECTION OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>tdbc::odbc::connection create</strong> object command
supports the <strong>-encoding</strong>, <strong>-isolation</strong>,
<strong>-readonly</strong> and <strong>-timeout</strong> options common
to all TDBC drivers. The <strong>-encoding</strong> option will succeed
only if the requested encoding is the same as the system encoding;
<strong>tdbc::odbc</strong> does not attempt to specify alternative
encodings to an ODBC driver. (Some drivers accept encoding
specifications in the connection string.)</p>
<p>In addition, if Tk is present in the requesting interpreter, and the
local system's ODBC driver manager supports a graphical user interface,
the <strong>tdbc::odbc::connection create</strong> object command
supports a <strong>-parent</strong> option, whose value is the path name
of a Tk window. If this option is specified, and a connection string
does not specify all the information needed to connect to an interface,
the ODBC driver manager will display a dialog box to request whatever
additional information is required. The requesting interpreter will
block until the user dismisses the dialog, at which point the connection
is made.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Sincs ODBC connection strings are driver specific, it is often
difficult to find the documentation needed to compose them. The
following examples are known to work on most Windows systems and provide
at least a few useful things that a program can do.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>tdbc::odbc::connection create db \
    &quot;DSN={PAYROLL};UID={aladdin};PWD={Sesame}&quot;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Connects to a named data source "PAYROLL", providing "aladdin" as a
user name and "Sesame" as a password. Uses <strong>db</strong> as the
name of the connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>set connString {DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.htmlb)};}
append connString {FIL={MS Access}\;}
append connString {DBQ=} \
    [file nativename [file normalize $fileName]]
tdbc::odbc::connection create db2 -readonly 1 $connString</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Opens a connection to a Microsoft Access database file whose name is
in <em>$fileName</em>. The database is opened in read-only mode. The
resulting connection is called "db2".</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>tdbc::odbc::connection create db3 \
    &quot;DRIVER=SQLite3;DATABASE=$fileName&quot;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Opens a connection to a SQLite3 database whose name is in
"$fileName".</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>tdbc::odbc::datasource add \
    {Microsoft Access Driver (*.htmlb)} \
    DSN=MyTestDatabase \
    DBQ=[file native [file normalize $fileName]]</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Creates a new user data source with the name, "MyTestDatabase" bound
to a Microsoft Access file whose path name is in "$fileName". No
connection is made to the data source until the program calls
<strong>tdbc::odbc::connection create</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>tdbc::odbc::datasource configure \
    {Microsoft Access Driver (*.htmlb)} \
    CREATE_DB=[file native [file normalize $fileName]] \
    General</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Creates a new, empty Microsoft Access database in the file identified
by "$fileName". No connection is made to the database until the program
calls <strong>tdbc::odbc::connection create</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="additional-connection-methods">ADDITIONAL CONNECTION
METHODS</h1>
<p>In addition to the usual methods on the tdbc::connection(n) object,
connections to an ODBC database support one additional method:</p>
<dl>
<dt>$connection</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method takes the given driver-native SQL code
<em>sqlStatement</em> and evaluates it without preparing it. The
statement is not tokenized and must not contain variable substitutions.
Evaluating the <em>sqlStatement</em> produces a result set of zero or
more rows. The result of the command is a list of dictionaries, with one
list element per row in the result set (in a similar format to the list
returned by <em>$connection allrows -as dicts</em>). <em>This command is
not recommended</em> for anything where the usual <em>prepare</em> or
<em>preparecall</em> methods work correctly. It is provided so that data
management language statements that are not implemented by the driver's
prepared statement API (such as <strong>CREATE</strong> DATABASE or
<strong>CREATE PROCEDURE</strong>), or that contain characters that are
reserved by the tokenizer, can be executed.</p>
