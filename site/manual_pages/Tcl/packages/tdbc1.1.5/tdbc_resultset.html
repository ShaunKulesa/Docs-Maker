<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Every database driver for TDBC (Tcl DataBase Connectivity) implements
a <em>result set</em> object that represents a the results returned from
executing SQL statement in a database. Instances of this object are
created by executing the <strong>execute</strong> object command on a
statement object.</p>
<p>The <strong>columns</strong> object command returns a list of the
names of the columns in the result set. The columns will appear in the
same order as they appeared in the SQL statement that performed the
database query. If the SQL statement does not return a set of columns
(for instance, if it is an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement), the
<strong>columns</strong> command will return an empty list.</p>
<p>The <strong>rowcount</strong> object command returns the number of
rows in the database that were affected by the execution of an INSERT,
UPDATE or DELETE statement. For a SELECT statement, the row count is
unspecified.</p>
<p>The <strong>nextlist</strong> object command sets the variable given
by <em>varname</em> in the caller's scope to the next row of the
results, expressed as a list of column values. NULL values are replaced
by empty strings. The columns of the result row appear in the same order
in which they appeared on the SELECT statement. The return of
<strong>nextlist</strong> is <strong>1</strong> if the operation
succeeded, and <strong>0</strong> if the end of the result set was
reached.</p>
<p>The <strong>nextdict</strong> object command sets the variable given
by <em>varname</em> in the caller's scope to the next row of the
results, expressed as a dictionary. The dictionary's keys are column
names, and the values are the values of those columns in the row. If a
column's value in the row is NULL, its key is omitted from the
dictionary. The keys appear in the dictionary in the same order in which
the columns appeared on the SELECT statement. The return of
<strong>nextdict</strong> is <strong>1</strong> if the operation
succeeded, and <strong>0</strong> if the end of the result set was
reached.</p>
<p>The <strong>nextrow</strong> object command is precisely equivalent
to the <strong>nextdict</strong> or <strong>nextlist</strong> object
command, depending on whether <strong>-as dicts</strong> (the default)
or <strong>-as lists</strong> is specified.</p>
<p>Some databases support the idea of a single statement that returns
multiple sets of results. The <strong>nextresults</strong> object
command is executed, typically after the <strong>nextlist</strong> of
<strong>nextdict</strong> object command has returned
<strong>0</strong>, to advance to the next result set. It returns
<strong>1</strong> if there is another result set to process, and
<strong>0</strong> if the result set just processed was the last. After
calling <strong>nextresults</strong> and getting the return value of
<strong>1</strong>, the caller may once again call
<strong>columns</strong> to get the column descriptions of the next
result set, and then return to calling <strong>nextdict</strong> or
<strong>nextlist</strong> to process the rows of the next result set. It
is an error to call <strong>columns</strong>, <strong>nextdict</strong>,
<strong>nextlist</strong> or <strong>nextrow</strong> after
<strong>nextresults</strong> has returned <strong>0</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>allrows</strong> object command sets the variable
designated by the <strong>-columnsvariable</strong> option (if present)
to the result of the <strong>columns</strong> object command. It then
executes the <strong>nextrow</strong> object command repeatedly until
the end of the result set is reached. If <strong>nextresults</strong>
returns a nonzero value, it executes the above two steps
(<strong>columns</strong> followed by iterated <strong>nextrow</strong>
calls) as long as further results are available. The rows returned by
<strong>nextrow</strong> are assembled into a Tcl list and become the
return value of the <strong>allrows</strong> command; the last value
returned from <strong>columns</strong> is what the application will see
in <strong>-columnsvariable</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>foreach</strong> object command sets the variable
designated by the <strong>-columnsvariable</strong> option (if present)
to the result of the <strong>columns</strong> object command. It then
executes the <strong>nextrow</strong> object command repeatedly until
the end of the result set is reached, storing the successive rows in the
variable designated by <em>varName</em>. For each row, it executes the
given <em>script</em>. If the script terminates with an error, the error
is reported by the <strong>foreach</strong> command, and iteration
stops. If the script performs a <strong>break</strong> operation, the
iteration terminates prematurely. If the script performs a
<strong>continue</strong> operation, the iteration recommences with the
next row. If the script performs a <strong>return</strong>, results are
the same as if a script outside the control of <strong>foreach</strong>
had returned. Any other unusual return code terminates the iteration and
is reported from the <strong>foreach</strong>.</p>
<p>Once <strong>nextrow</strong> returns <strong>0</strong>, the
<strong>foreach</strong> object command tries to advance to the next
result set using <strong>nextresults</strong>. If
<strong>nextresults</strong> returns <strong>1</strong>, the above steps
(<strong>columns</strong> and <strong>nextrow</strong>, with script
invocation) are repeated as long as more result sets remain. The
<em>script</em> will always see the correct description of the columns
of the current result set in the variable designated byt
<strong>-columnsvariable</strong>. At the end of the call, the variable
designated by <strong>-columnsvariable</strong> will have the
description of the columns of the last result set.</p>
<p>The <strong>close</strong> object command deletes the result set and
frees any associated system resources.</p>
