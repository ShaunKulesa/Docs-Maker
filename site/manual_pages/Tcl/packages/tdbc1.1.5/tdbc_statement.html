<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Every database driver for TDBC (Tcl DataBase Connectivity) implements
a <em>statement</em> object that represents a SQL statement in a
database. Instances of this object are created by executing the
<strong>prepare</strong> or <strong>preparecall</strong> object command
on a database connection.</p>
<p>The <strong>prepare</strong> object command against the connection
accepts arbitrary SQL code to be executed against the database. The SQL
code may contain <em>bound</em> variables, which are strings of
alphanumeric characters or underscores (the first character of the
string may not be numeric), prefixed with a colon (<strong>:</strong>).
If a bound variable appears in the SQL statement, and is not in a string
set off by single or double quotes, nor in a comment introduced by
<strong>--</strong>, it becomes a value that is substituted when the
statement is executed. A bound variable becomes a single value (string
or numeric) in the resulting statement. <em>Drivers are responsible for
ensuring that the mechanism</em> for binding variables prevents SQL
injection.</p>
<p>The <strong>preparecall</strong> object command against the
connection accepts a stylized statement in the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>procname (?:varname? ?,:varname...?)</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>varname = procname (?:varname? ?,:varname...?)</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement represents a call to a stored procedure
<em>procname</em> in the database. The variable name to the left of the
equal sign (if present), and all variable names that are parameters
inside parentheses, become bound variables.</p>
<p>The <strong>params</strong> method against a statement object
enumerates the bound variables that appear in the statement. The result
returned from the <strong>params</strong> method is a dictionary whose
keys are the names of bound variables (listed in the order in which the
variables first appear in the statement), and whose values are
dictionaries. The subdictionaries include at least the following keys
(database drivers may add additional keys that are not in this
list).</p>
<dl>
<dt>direction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains one of the keywords, <strong>in</strong>,
<strong>out</strong> or <strong>inout</strong> according to whether the
variable is an input to or output from the statement. Only stored
procedure calls will have <strong>out</strong> or <strong>inout</strong>
parameters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the data type of the column, and will generally be chosen
from the set, <strong>bigint</strong>, <strong>binary</strong>,
<strong>bit</strong>, <strong>char</strong>, <strong>date</strong>,
<strong>decimal</strong>, <strong>double</strong>,
<strong>float</strong>, <strong>integer</strong>,
<strong>longvarbinary</strong>, <strong>longvarchar</strong>,
<strong>numeric</strong>, <strong>real</strong>, <strong>time</strong>,
<strong>timestamp</strong>, <strong>smallint</strong>,
<strong>tinyint</strong>, <strong>varbinary</strong>, and
<strong>varchar</strong>. (If the variable has a type that cannot be
represented as one of the above, <strong>type</strong> will contain a
driver-dependent description of the type.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>precision</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the precision of the column in bits, decimal digits, or the
width in characters, according to the type.</p>
</dd>
<dt>scale</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the scale of the column (the number of digits after the
radix point), for types that support the concept.</p>
</dd>
<dt>nullable</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains 1 if the column can contain NULL values, and 0
otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>paramtype</strong> object command allows the script to
specify the type and direction of parameter transmission of a variable
in a statement. (Some databases provide no method to determine this
information automatically and place the burden on the caller to do so.)
The <em>direction</em>, <em>type</em>, <em>precision</em>,
<em>scale</em>, and <em>nullable</em> arguments have the same meaning as
the corresponding dictionary values in the <strong>params</strong>
object command.</p>
<p>The <strong>execute</strong> object command executes the statement.
Prior to executing the statement, values are provided for the bound
variables that appear in it. If the <em>dict</em> parameter is supplied,
it is searched for a key whose name matches the name of the bound
variable. If the key is present, its value becomes the substituted
variable. If not, the value of the substituted variable becomes a SQL
NULL. If the <em>dict</em> parameter is <em>not</em> supplied, the
<strong>execute</strong> object command searches for a variable in the
caller's scope whose name matches the name of the bound variable. If one
is found, its value becomes the bound variable's value. If none is
found, the bound variable is assigned a SQL NULL as its value. Once
substitution is finished, the resulting statement is executed. The
return value is a result set object (see
<strong>tdbc::resultset</strong> for details).</p>
<p>The <strong>resultsets</strong> method returns a list of all the
result sets that have been returned by executing the statement and have
not yet been closed.</p>
<p>The <strong>allrows</strong> object command executes the statement as
with the <strong>execute</strong> object command, accepting an optional
<em>dict</em> parameter giving bind variables. After executing the
statement, it uses the <em>allrows</em> object command on the result set
(see <strong>tdbc::resultset</strong>) to construct a list of the
results. Finally, the result set is closed. The return value is the list
of results.</p>
<p>The <strong>foreach</strong> object command executes the statement as
with the <strong>execute</strong> object command, accepting an optional
<em>dict</em> parameter giving bind variables. After executing the
statement, it uses the <em>foreach</em> object command on the result set
(see <strong>tdbc::resultset</strong>) to evaluate the given
<em>script</em> for each row of the results. Finally, the result set is
closed, even if the given <em>script</em> results in a
<strong>return</strong>, an error, or an unusual return code.</p>
<p>The <strong>close</strong> object command removes a statement and any
result sets that it has created. All system resources associated with
the objects are freed.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The following code would look up a telephone number in a directory,
assuming an appropriate SQL schema:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>package require tdbc::sqlite3
tdbc::sqlite3::connection create db phonebook.sqlite3
set statement [db prepare {
    select phone_num from directory
    where first_name = :firstname and last_name = :lastname
}]
set firstname Fred
set lastname Flintstone
$statement foreach row {
    puts [dict get $row phone_num]
}
$statement close
db close</code></pre>
