<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Every database driver for TDBC (Tcl DataBase Connectivity) implements
a <em>connection</em> object that represents a connection to a database.
By convention, this object is created by the command,
<strong>tdbc::</strong><em>driver</em><strong>::connection
create</strong>. This command accepts the name of a Tcl command that
will represent the connection and a possible set of options (see
<strong>CONFIGURATION</strong> OPTIONS). It establishes a connection to
the database and returns the name of the newly-created Tcl command.</p>
<p>The <strong>configure</strong> object command on a database
connection, if presented with no arguments, returns a list of
alternating keywords and values representing the connection's current
configuration. If presented with a single argument <em>-option</em>, it
returns the configured value of the given option. Otherwise, it must be
given an even number of arguments which are alternating options and
values. The specified options receive the specified values, and nothing
is returned.</p>
<p>The <strong>close</strong> object command on a database connection
closes the connection. All active statements and result sets on the
connection are closed. Any uncommitted transaction is rolled back. The
object command is deleted.</p>
<p>The <strong>prepare</strong> object command on a database connection
prepares a SQL statement for execution. The <em>sql-code</em> argument
must contain a single SQL statement to be executed. Bound variables may
be included. The return value is a newly-created Tcl command that
represents the statement. See <strong>tdbc::statement</strong> for more
detailed discussion of the SQL accepted by the <strong>prepare</strong>
object command and the interface accepted by a statement.</p>
<p>On a database connection where the underlying database and driver
support stored procedures, the <strong>preparecall</strong> object
command prepares a call to a stored procedure for execution. The syntax
of the stored procedure call is:</p>
<p>?<em>resultvar</em> =? <em>procname</em>(?<em>arg</em> ?,
<em>arg</em>...?)</p>
<p>The return value is a newly-created Tcl command that represents the
statement. See <strong>tdbc::statement</strong> for the interface
accepted by a statement.</p>
<p>The <strong>statements</strong> object command returns a list of
statements that have been created by <strong>prepare</strong> and
<strong>preparecall</strong> statements against the given connection and
have not yet been closed.</p>
<p>The <strong>resultsets</strong> object command returns a list of
result sets that have been obtained by executing statements prepared
using the given connection and not yet closed.</p>
<p>The <strong>tables</strong> object command allows the program to
query the connection for the names of tables that exist in the database.
The optional <em>pattern</em> parameter is a pattern to match the name
of a table. It may contain the SQL wild-card characters
'<strong>%</strong>' and and whose values are subdictionaries. See the
documentation for the individual database driver for the interpretation
of the values.</p>
<p>The <strong>columns</strong> object command allows the program to
query the connection for the names of columns that exist in a given
table. The optional <strong>pattern</strong> parameter is a pattern to
match the name of a column. It may contain the SQL wild-card characters
'<strong>%</strong>' and and whose values are dictionaries. Each of the
subdictionaries will contain at least the following keys and values (and
may contain others whose usage is determined by a specific database
driver).</p>
<dl>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the data type of the column, and will generally be chosen
from the set, <strong>bigint</strong>, <strong>binary</strong>,
<strong>bit</strong>, <strong>char</strong>, <strong>date</strong>,
<strong>decimal</strong>, <strong>double</strong>,
<strong>float</strong>, <strong>integer</strong>,
<strong>longvarbinary</strong>, <strong>longvarchar</strong>,
<strong>numeric</strong>, <strong>real</strong>, <strong>time</strong>,
<strong>timestamp</strong>, <strong>smallint</strong>,
<strong>tinyint</strong>, <strong>varbinary</strong>, and
<strong>varchar</strong>. (If the column has a type that cannot be
represented as one of the above, <strong>type</strong> will contain a
driver-dependent description of the type.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>precision</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the precision of the column in bits, decimal digits, or the
width in characters, according to the type.</p>
</dd>
<dt>scale</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the scale of the column (the number of digits after the
radix point), for types that support the concept.</p>
</dd>
<dt>nullable</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains 1 if the column can contain NULL values, and 0
otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>primarykeys</strong> object command allows the program to
query the connection for the primary keys belonging to a given table.
The <em>tableName</em> parameter identifies the table being
interrogated. The result is a list of dictionaries enumerating the keys
(in a similar format to the list returned by <em>$connection</em>
<strong>allrows -as dicts</strong>). The keys of the dictionary may
include at least the following. Values that are NULL or meaningless in a
given database are omitted.</p>
<dl>
<dt>tableCatalog</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the catalog in which the table appears.</p>
</dd>
<dt>tableSchema</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the schema in which the table appears.</p>
</dd>
<dt>tableName</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the table owning the primary key.</p>
</dd>
<dt>constraintCatalog</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the catalog in which the primary key constraint appears. In
some database systems, this may not be the same as the table's
catalog.</p>
</dd>
<dt>constraintSchema</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the schema in which the primary key constraint appears. In
some database systems, this may not be the same as the table's
schema.</p>
</dd>
<dt>constraintName</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the primary key constraint,</p>
</dd>
<dt>columnName</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of a column that is a member of the primary key.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ordinalPosition</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ordinal position of the column within the primary key.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To these columns may be added additional ones that are specific to a
particular database system.</p>
<p>The <strong>foreignkeys</strong> object command allows the program to
query the connection for foreign key relationships that apply to a
particular table. The relationships may be constrained to the keys that
appear in a particular table (<strong>-foreign</strong>
<em>tableName</em>), the keys that refer to a particular table
(<strong>-primary</strong> <em>tableName</em>), or both. At least one of
<strong>-primary</strong> and <strong>-foreign</strong> should be
specified, although some drivers will enumerate all foreign keys in the
current catalog if both options are omitted. The result of the
<strong>foreignkeys</strong> object command is a list of dictionaries,
with one list element per key (in a similar format to the list returned
by <em>$connection</em> <strong>allrows -as dicts</strong>). The keys of
the dictionary may include at least the following. Values that are NULL
or meaningless in a given database are omitted.</p>
<dl>
<dt>foreignConstraintCatalog</dt>

column to which the foreign key refers.</p>
</dd>

</dl>
<p>The <strong>begintransaction</strong> object command on a database
connection begins a transaction on the database. If the underlying
database does not support atomic, consistent, isolated, durable
transactions, the <strong>begintransaction</strong> object command
returns an error reporting the fact. Similarly, if multiple
<strong>begintransaction</strong> commands are executed withough an
intervening <strong>commit</strong> or <strong>rollback</strong>
command, an error is returned unless the underlying database supports
nested transactions.</p>
<p>The <strong>commit</strong> object command on a database connection
ends the most recent transaction started by
<strong>begintransaction</strong> and commits changes to the
database.</p>
<p>The <strong>rollback</strong> object command on a database connection
rolls back the most recent transaction started by
<strong>begintransaction</strong>. The state of the database is as if
nothing happened during the transaction.</p>
<p>The <strong>transaction</strong> object command on a database
connection presents a simple way of bundling a database transaction. It
begins a transaction, and evaluates the supplied <em>script</em>
argument as a Tcl script in the caller's scope. If <em>script</em>
terminates normally, or by <strong>break</strong>,
<strong>continue</strong>, or <strong>return</strong>, the transaction
is committed (and any action requested by <strong>break</strong>,
<strong>continue</strong>, or <strong>return</strong> takes place). If
the commit fails for any reason, the error in the commit is treated as
an error in the <em>script</em>. In the case of an error in
<em>script</em> or in the commit, the transaction is rolled back and the
error is rethrown. Any nonstandard return code from the script causes
the transaction to be rolled back and then is rethrown.</p>
<p>The <strong>allrows</strong> object command prepares a SQL statement
(given by the <em>sql-code</em> parameter) to execute against the
database. It then executes it (see <strong>tdbc::statement</strong> for
details) with the optional <em>dictionary</em> parameter giving bind
variables. Finally, it uses the <em>allrows</em> object command on the
result set (see <strong>tdbc::resultset</strong>) to construct a list of
the results. Finally, both result set and statement are closed. The
return value is the list of results.</p>
<p>The <strong>foreach</strong> object command prepares a SQL statement
(given by the <em>sql-code</em> parameter) to execute against the
database. It then executes it (see <strong>tdbc::statement</strong> for
details) with the optional <em>dictionary</em> parameter giving bind
variables. Finally, it uses the <em>foreach</em> object command on the
result set (see <strong>tdbc::resultset</strong>) to evaluate the given
<em>script</em> for each row of the results. Finally, both result set
and statement are closed, even if the given <em>script</em> results in a
<strong>return</strong>, an error, or an unusual return code.</p>
<h1 id="configuration-options">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The configuration options accepted when the connection is created and
on the connection's <strong>configure</strong> object command include
the following, and may include others specific to a database driver.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-encoding name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the encoding to be used in connecting to the database. The
<em>name</em> should be one of the names accepted by the
<strong>encoding</strong> command. This option is usually unnecessary;
most database drivers can figure out the encoding in use by
themselves.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-isolation level</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the transaction isolation level needed for transactions on
the database. The acceptable values for <em>level</em> are shown under
<strong>TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVELS</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-timeout ms</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the maximum time to wait for a an operation database engine
before reporting an error to the caller. The <em>ms</em> argument gives
the maximum time in milliseconds. A value of zero (the default)
specifies that the calling process is to wait indefinitely for database
operations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-readonly flag</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the connection will not modify the database (if the
Boolean parameter <em>flag</em> is true), or that it may modify the
database (if <em>flag</em> is false). If <em>flag</em> is true, this
option may have the effect of raising the transaction isolation level to
<em>readonly</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="transaction-isolation-levels">TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVELS</h2>
<p>The acceptable values for the <strong>-isolation</strong>
configuration option are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>readuncommitted</dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows the transaction to read "dirty", that is, uncommitted data.
This isolation level may compromise data integrity, does not guarantee
that foreign keys or uniqueness constraints are satisfied, and in
general does not guarantee data consistency.</p>
</dd>
<dt>readcommitted</dt>
<dd>
<p>Forbids the transaction from reading "dirty" data, but does not
guarantee repeatable reads; if a transaction reads a row of a database
at a given time, there is no guarantee that the same row will be
available at a later time in the same transaction.</p>
</dd>
<dt>repeatableread</dt>
<dd>
<p>Guarantees that any row of the database, once read, will have the
same values for the life of a transaction. Still permits "phantom reads"
(that is, newly-added rows appearing if a table is queried a second
time).</p>
</dd>
<dt>serializable</dt>
<dd>
<p>The most restrictive (and most expensive) level of transaction
isolation. Any query to the database, if repeated, will return precisely
the same results for the life of the transaction, exactly as if the
transaction is the only user of the database.</p>
</dd>
<dt>readonly</dt>
<dd>
<p>Behaves like <strong>serializable</strong> in that the only results
visible to the transaction are those that were committed prior to the
start of the transaction, but forbids the transaction from modifying the
database.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A database that does not implement one of these isolation levels will
instead use the next more restrictive isolation level. If the given
level of isolation cannot be obtained, the database interface throws an
error reporting the fact. The default isolation level is
<strong>readcommitted</strong>.</p>
<p>A script should not the isolation level when a transaction is in
progress.</p>
