<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Tcl Database Connectivity (TDBC) is a common interface for Tcl
programs to access SQL databases. It is implemented by a series of
database <em>drivers</em>: separate modules, each of which adapts Tcl to
the interface of one particular database system. All of the drivers
implement a common series of commands for manipulating the database.
These commands are all named dynamically, since they all represent
objects in the database system. They include
<strong>connections,</strong> which represent connections to a database;
<strong>statements,</strong> which represent SQL statements, and
<strong>result sets,</strong> which represent the sets of rows that
result from executing statements. All of these have manual pages of
their own, listed under <strong>SEE ALSO</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, TDBC itself has a few service procedures that are
chiefly of interest to driver writers. <strong>SEE ALSO</strong> also
enumerates them.</p>
