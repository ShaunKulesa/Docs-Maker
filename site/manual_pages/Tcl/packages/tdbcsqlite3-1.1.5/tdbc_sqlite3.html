<p>tdbc::sqlite3 - TDBC driver for the SQLite3 database manager</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>package require <strong>tdbc::sqlite3 1.0</strong></p>
<p><strong>tdbc::sqlite3::connection create</strong> <em>db</em>
<em>fileName</em> ?<em>-option value...</em>?</p>

</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>tdbc::sqlite3</strong> driver provides a database
interface that conforms to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a
Tcl script to connect to a SQLite3 database. It is also provided as a
worked example of how to write a database driver in Tcl, so that driver
authors have a starting point for further development.</p>
<p>Connection to a SQLite3 database is established by invoking
<strong>tdbc::sqlite3::connection create</strong>, passing it a string
to be used as the connection handle followed by the file name of the
database. The side effect of <strong>tdbc::sqlite3::connection</strong>
create is to create a new database connection.. As an alternative,
<strong>tdbc::sqlite::connection new</strong> may be used to create a
database connection with an automatically assigned name. The return
value from <strong>tdbc::sqlite::connection new</strong> is the name
that was chosen for the connection handle. See
<strong>tdbc::connection(n)</strong> for the details of how to use the
connection to manipulate a database.</p>
<h1 id="configuration-options">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The standard configuration options <strong>-encoding</strong>,
<strong>-isolation</strong>, <strong>-readonly</strong> and
<strong>-timeout</strong> are all recognized, both on
<strong>tdbc::sqlite3::connection create</strong> and on the
<strong>configure</strong> method of the resulting connection.</p>
<p>Since the encoding of a SQLite3 database is always well known, the
<strong>-encoding</strong> option accepts only <strong>utf-8</strong> as
an encoding and always returns <strong>utf-8</strong> for an encoding.
The actual encoding may be set using a SQLite3 <strong>PRAGMA</strong>
statement when creating a new database.</p>
<p>Only the isolation levels <strong>readuncommitted</strong> and
<strong>serializable</strong> are implemented. Other isolation levels
are promoted to <strong>serializable</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>-readonly</strong> flag is not implemented.
<strong>-readonly 0</strong> is accepted silently, while
<strong>-readonly 1</strong> reports an error.</p>
<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>If any column name is not unique among the columns in a result set,
the results of <strong>-as dicts</strong> returns will be missing all
but the rightmost of the duplicated columns. This limitation can be
worked around by adding appropriate <strong>AS</strong> clauses to
<strong>SELECT</strong> statements to ensure that all returned column
names are unique. Plans are to fix this bug by using a C implementation
of the driver, which will also improve performance significantly.</p>
