<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>One of the fundamental constructs in <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> is
the widget definition. A widget is like a class with some additional
features. Each widget acts as a template for actual objects that can be
created. The widget itself is a namespace which contains things common
to all objects. Each object has its own unique bundle of data which
contains instances of the "variables" defined in the widget definition.
Each object also has a built-in variable named "this", which contains
the name of the object. Widgets can also have "common" data members that
are shared by all objects in a widget.</p>
<p>Two types of functions can be included in the widget definition.
"Methods" are functions which operate on a specific object, and
therefore have access to both "variables" and "common" data members.
"Procs" are ordinary procedures in the widget namespace, and only have
access to "common" data members.</p>
<p>If the body of any method or proc starts with "**<span
class="citation" data-cites="*">@*</span>*", it is treated as the
symbolic name for a C procedure. Otherwise, it is treated as a Tcl code
script. See below for details on registering and using C procedures.</p>
<p>A widget can only be defined once, although the bodies of widget
methods and procs can be defined again and again for interactive
debugging. See the <strong>body</strong> and <strong>configbody</strong>
commands for details.</p>
<p>Each namespace can have its own collection of objects and widgets.
The list of widgets available in the current context can be queried
using the "<strong>itcl::find widgets</strong>" command, and the list of
objects, with the "<strong>itcl::find objects</strong>" command.</p>
<p>A widget can be deleted using the "<strong>delete widget</strong>"
command. Individual objects can be deleted using the "<strong>delete
object</strong>" command.</p>
<h1 id="widget-definitions">WIDGET DEFINITIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>widget</strong> <em>widgetName definition</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides the definition for a widget named <em>widgetName</em>. If
the widget <em>widgetName</em> already exists, or if a command called
<em>widgetName</em> exists in the current namespace context, this
command returns an error. If the widget definition is successfully
parsed, <em>widgetName</em> becomes a command in the current context,
handling the creation of objects for this widget.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The widget <em>definition</em> is evaluated as a series of Tcl
statements that define elements within the widget. The following widget
definition commands are recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>inherit</strong> <em>baseWidget</em>
?<em>baseWidget</em>...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes the current widget to inherit characteristics from one or more
base widgets. Widgets must have been defined by a previous
<strong>widget</strong> command, or must be available to the
auto-loading facility (see "AUTO-LOADING" below). A single widget
definition can contain no more than one <strong>inherit</strong>
command.</p>
<p>The order of <em>baseWidget</em> names in the
<strong>inherit</strong> list affects the name resolution for widget
members. When the same member name appears in two or more base widgets,
the base widget that appears first in the <strong>inherit</strong> list
takes precedence. For example, if widgets "Foo" and "Bar" both contain
the member "x", and if another widget has the "<strong>inherit</strong>"
statement:</p>
<pre><code>inherit Foo Bar</code></pre>
<p>then the name "x" means "Foo::x". Other inherited members named "x"
must be referenced with their explicit name, like "Bar::x".</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>constructor</strong> <em>args</em> ?<em>init</em>?
<em>body</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Declares the <em>args</em> argument list and <em>body</em> used for
the constructor, which is automatically invoked whenever an object is
created.</p>
<p>Before the <em>body</em> is executed, the optional <em>init</em>
statement is used to invoke any base widget constructors that require
arguments. Variables in the <em>args</em> specification can be accessed
in the <em>init</em> code fragment, and passed to base widget
constructors. After evaluating the <em>init</em> statement, any base
widget constructors that have not been executed are invoked
automatically without arguments. This ensures that all base widgets are
fully constructed before the constructor <em>body</em> is executed. By
default, this scheme causes constructors to be invoked in order from
least- to most-specific. This is exactly the opposite of the order that
widgets are reported by the <strong>info heritage</strong> command.</p>
<p>If construction is successful, the constructor always returns the
object name-regardless of how the <em>body</em> is defined-and the
object name becomes a command in the current namespace context. If
construction fails, an error message is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>destructor</strong> <em>body</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Declares the <em>body</em> used for the destructor, which is
automatically invoked when an object is deleted. If the destructor is
successful, the object data is destroyed and the object name is removed
as a command from the interpreter. If destruction fails, an error
message is returned and the object remains.</p>
<p>When an object is destroyed, all destructors in its widget hierarchy
are invoked in order from most- to least-specific. This is the order
that the widgets are reported by the "<strong>info heritage</strong>"
command, and it is exactly the opposite of the default constructor
order.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>method</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>args</em>?
?<em>body</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Declares a method called <em>name</em>. When the method <em>body</em>
is executed, it will have automatic access to object-specific variables
and common data members.</p>
<p>If the <em>args</em> list is specified, it establishes the usage
information for this method. The <strong>body</strong> command can be
used to redefine the method body, but the <em>args</em> list must match
this specification.</p>
<p>Within the body of another widget method, a method can be invoked
like any other command-simply by using its name. Outside of the widget
context, the method name must be prefaced an object name, which provides
the context for the data that it manipulates. Methods in a base widget
that are redefined in the current widget, or hidden by another base
widget, can be qualified using the
"<em>widgetName</em>::<em>method</em>" syntax.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>proc</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>args</em>?
?<em>body</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Declares a proc called <em>name</em>. A proc is an ordinary procedure
within the widget namespace. Unlike a method, a proc is invoked without
referring to a specific object. When the proc <em>body</em> is executed,
it will have automatic access only to common data members.</p>
<p>If the <em>args</em> list is specified, it establishes the usage
information for this proc. The <strong>body</strong> command can be used
to redefine the proc body, but the <em>args</em> list must match this
specification.</p>
<p>Within the body of another widget method or proc, a proc can be
invoked like any other command-simply by using its name. In any other
namespace context, the proc is invoked using a qualified name like
"<em>widgetName</em><strong>::</strong><em>proc</em>". Procs in a base
widget that are redefined in the current widget, or hidden by another
base widget, can also be accessed via their qualified name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>variable</strong> <em>varName</em> ?<em>init</em>?
?<em>config</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines an object-specific variable named <em>varName</em>. All
object-specific variables are automatically available in widget methods.
They need not be declared with anything like the <strong>global</strong>
command.</p>
<p>If the optional <em>init</em> string is specified, it is used as the
initial value of the variable when a new object is created.
Initialization forces the variable to be a simple scalar value;
uninitialized variables, on the other hand, can be set within the
constructor and used as arrays.</p>
<p>The optional <em>config</em> script is only allowed for public
variables. If specified, this code fragment is executed whenever a
public variable is modified by the built-in "configure" method. The
<em>config</em> script can also be specified outside of the widget
definition using the <strong>configbody</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>common</strong> <em>varName</em> ?<em>init</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Declares a common variable named <em>varName</em>. Common variables
reside in the widget namespace and are shared by all objects belonging
to the widget. They are just like global variables, except that they
need not be declared with the usual <strong>global</strong> command.
They are automatically visible in all widget methods and procs.</p>
<p>If the optional <em>init</em> string is specified, it is used as the
initial value of the variable. Initialization forces the variable to be
a simple scalar value; uninitialized variables, on the other hand, can
be set with subsequent <strong>set</strong> and <strong>array</strong>
commands and used as arrays.</p>
<p>Once a common data member has been defined, it can be set using
<strong>set</strong> and <strong>array</strong> commands within the
widget definition. This allows common data members to be initialized as
arrays. For example:</p>
<pre><code>itcl::widget Foo {
    protected common boolean
    set boolean(true) 1
    set boolean(false) 0
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that if common data members are initialized within the
constructor, they get initialized again and again whenever new objects
are created.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>public</strong> <em>command</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>protected</strong> <em>command</em> ?<em>arg arg
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>private</strong> <em>command</em> ?<em>arg arg
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>These commands are used to set the protection level for widget
members that are created when <em>command</em> is evaluated. The
<em>command</em> is usually <strong>method</strong>,
<strong>proc</strong>, <strong>variable</strong>
or<strong>common</strong>, and the remaining <em>arg</em>'s complete the
member definition. However, <em>command</em> can also be a script
containing many different member definitions, and the protection level
will apply to all of the members that are created.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="widget-usage">WIDGET USAGE</h1>
<p>Once a widget has been defined, the widget name can be used as a
command to create new objects belonging to the widget.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>widgetName objName</em> ?<em>args...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a new object in widget <em>widgetName</em> with the name
<em>objName</em>. Remaining arguments are passed to the constructor of
the most-specific widget. This in turn passes arguments to base widget
constructors before invoking its own body of commands. If construction
is successful, a command called <em>objName</em> is created in the
current namespace context, and <em>objName</em> is returned as the
result of this operation. If an error is encountered during
construction, the destructors are automatically invoked to free any
resources that have been allocated, the object is deleted, and an error
is returned.</p>
<p>If <em>objName</em> contains the string "<strong>#auto</strong>",
that string is replaced with an automatically generated name. Names have
the form <em>widgetName&lt;number&gt;</em>, where the
<em>widgetName</em> part is modified to start with a lowercase letter.
In widget "Toaster", for example, the "<strong>#auto</strong>"
specification would produce names like toaster0, toaster1, etc. Note
that "<strong>#auto</strong>" can be also be buried within an object
name:</p>
<pre><code>fileselectiondialog .foo.bar.#auto -background red</code></pre>
<p>This would generate an object named
".foo.bar.fileselectiondialog0".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="object-usage">OBJECT USAGE</h1>
<p>Once an object has been created, the object name can be used as a
command to invoke methods that operate on the object.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>objName method</em> ?<em>args...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Invokes a method named <em>method</em> on an object named
<em>objName</em>. Remaining arguments are passed to the argument list
for the method. The method name can be "constructor", "destructor", any
method name appearing in the widget definition, or any of the following
built-in methods.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="built-in-methods">BUILT-IN METHODS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>cget option</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides access to public variables as configuration options. This
mimics the behavior of the usual "cget" operation for Tk widgets. The
<em>option</em> argument is a string of the form
"<strong>-</strong><em>varName</em>", and this method returns the
current value of the public variable <em>varName</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>?
?<em>value option value ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides access to public variables as configuration options. This
mimics the behavior of the usual "configure" operation for Tk widgets.
With no arguments, this method returns a list of lists describing all of
the public variables. Each list has three elements: the variable name,
its initial value and its current value.</p>
<p>If a single <em>option</em> of the form
"<strong>-</strong><em>varName</em>" is specified, then this method
returns the information for that one variable.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the arguments are treated as
<em>option</em>/<em>value</em> pairs assigning new values to public
variables. Each variable is assigned its new value, and if it has any
"config" code associated with it, it is executed in the context of the
widget where it was defined. If the "config" code generates an error,
the variable is set back to its previous value, and the
<strong>configure</strong> method returns an error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>isa</strong> <em>widgetName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns non-zero if the given <em>widgetName</em> can be found in the
object's heritage, and zero otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>info</strong> <em>option</em>
?<em>args...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns information related to a particular object named
<em>objName</em>, or to its widget definition. The <em>option</em>
parameter includes the following things, as well as the options
recognized by the usual Tcl "info" command:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>info widget</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the most-specific widget for object
<em>objName</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>info inherit</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the list of base widgets as they were defined in the
"<strong>inherit</strong>" command, or an empty string if this widget
has no base widgets.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>info heritage</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the current widget name and the entire list of base widgets
in the order that they are traversed for member lookup and object
destruction.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>info function</strong> ?<em>cmdName</em>?
?<strong>-protection</strong>? ?<strong>-type</strong>?
?<strong>-name</strong>? ?<strong>-args</strong>?
?<strong>-body</strong>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>With no arguments, this command returns a list of all widgets methods
and procs. If <em>cmdName</em> is specified, it returns information for
a specific method or proc. If no flags are specified, this command
returns a list with the following elements: the protection level, the
type (method/proc), the qualified name, the argument list and the body.
Flags can be used to request specific elements from this list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>objName</em> <strong>info variable</strong> ?<em>varName</em>?
?<strong>-protection</strong>? ?<strong>-type</strong>?
?<strong>-name</strong>? ?<strong>-init</strong>?
?<strong>-value</strong>? ?<strong>-config</strong>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>With no arguments, this command returns a list of all object-specific
variables and common data members. If <em>varName</em> is specified, it
returns information for a specific data member. If no flags are
specified, this command returns a list with the following elements: the
protection level, the type (variable/common), the qualified name, the
initial value, and the current value. If <em>varName</em> is a public
variable, the "config" code is included on this list. Flags can be used
to request specific elements from this list.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="chaining-methodsprocs">CHAINING METHODS/PROCS</h1>
<p>Sometimes a base widget has a method or proc that is redefined with
the same name in a derived widget. This is a way of making the derived
widget handle the same operations as the base widget, but with its own
specialized behavior. For example, suppose we have a Toaster widget that
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>itcl::widget Toaster {
    variable crumbs 0
    method toast {nslices} {
        if {$crumbs &gt; 50} {
            error &quot;== FIRE! FIRE! ==&quot;
        }
        set crumbs [expr {$crumbs+4*$nslices}]
    }
    method clean {} {
        set crumbs 0
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We might create another widget like SmartToaster that redefines the
"toast" method. If we want to access the base widget method, we can
qualify it with the base widget name, to avoid ambiguity:</p>
<pre><code>itcl::widget SmartToaster {
    inherit Toaster
    method toast {nslices} {
        if {$crumbs &gt; 40} {
            clean
        }
        return [Toaster::toast $nslices]
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Instead of hard-coding the base widget name, we can use the "chain"
command like this:</p>
<pre><code>itcl::widget SmartToaster {
    inherit Toaster
    method toast {nslices} {
        if {$crumbs &gt; 40} {
            clean
        }
        return [chain $nslices]
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The chain command searches through the widget hierarchy for a
slightly more generic (base widget) implementation of a method or proc,
and invokes it with the specified arguments. It starts at the current
widget context and searches through base widgets in the order that they
are reported by the "info heritage" command. If another implementation
is not found, this command does nothing and returns the null string.</p>
<h1 id="auto-loading">AUTO-LOADING</h1>
<p>Widget definitions need not be loaded explicitly; they can be loaded
as needed by the usual Tcl auto-loading facility. Each directory
containing widget definition files should have an accompanying
"tclIndex" file. Each line in this file identifies a Tcl procedure or
<strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> widget definition and the file where the
definition can be found.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a directory contains the definitions for widgets
"Toaster" and "SmartToaster". Then the "tclIndex" file for this
directory would look like:</p>
<pre><code># Tcl autoload index file, version 2.0 for [incr Tcl]
# This file is generated by the &quot;auto_mkindex&quot; command
# and sourced to set up indexing information for one or
# more commands.  Typically each line is a command that
# sets an element in the auto_index array, where the
# element name is the name of a command and the value is
# a script that loads the command.

set auto_index(::Toaster) &quot;source $dir/Toaster.itcl&quot;
set auto_index(::SmartToaster) &quot;source $dir/SmartToaster.itcl&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>auto_mkindex</strong> command is used to automatically
generate "tclIndex" files.</p>
<p>The auto-loader must be made aware of this directory by appending the
directory name to the "auto_path" variable. When this is in place,
widgets will be auto-loaded as needed when used in an application.</p>
<h1 id="c-procedures">C PROCEDURES</h1>
<p>C procedures can be integrated into an <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong>
widget definition to implement methods, procs, and the "config" code for
public variables. Any body that starts with "**<span class="citation"
data-cites="*">@*</span>*" is treated as the symbolic name for a C
procedure.</p>
<p>Symbolic names are established by registering procedures via
<strong>Itcl_RegisterC()</strong>. This is usually done in the
<strong>Tcl_AppInit()</strong> procedure, which is automatically called
when the interpreter starts up. In the following example, the procedure
<code>My_FooCmd()</code> is registered with the symbolic name "foo".
This procedure can be referenced in the <strong>body</strong> command as
"<code>@foo</code>".</p>
<pre><code>int
Tcl_AppInit(interp)
    Tcl_Interp *interp;     /* Interpreter for application. */
{
    if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }

    if (Itcl_RegisterC(interp, &quot;foo&quot;, My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>C procedures are implemented just like ordinary Tcl commands. See the
<strong>CrtCommand</strong> man page for details. Within the procedure,
widget data members can be accessed like ordinary variables using
<strong>Tcl_SetVar()</strong>, <strong>Tcl_GetVar()</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_TraceVar()</strong>, etc. Widget methods and procs can be
executed like ordinary commands using <strong>Tcl_Eval()</strong>.
<strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> makes this possible by automatically setting
up the context before executing the C procedure.</p>
<p>This scheme provides a natural migration path for code development.
Widgets can be developed quickly using Tcl code to implement the bodies.
An entire application can be built and tested. When necessary,
individual bodies can be implemented with C code to improve
performance.</p>
