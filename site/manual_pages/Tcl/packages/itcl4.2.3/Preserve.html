<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures are used to allocate and release memory, especially
blocks of memory that will be used by multiple independent modules. They
are similar in function to the routines in the public Tcl interface,
<strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>, <strong>Tcl_Free</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong>, <strong>Tcl_Release</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_EventuallyFree</strong>. The Tcl routines suffer from issues
with performance scaling as the number of blocks managed grows large.
The facilities of Itcl encounter these performance scaling issues and
require an alternative that does not suffer from them.</p>
<p><strong>Itcl_Alloc</strong> returns an untyped pointer to an
allocated block of memory of at least <em>size</em> bytes. All
<em>size</em> bytes are initialized to zero.</p>
<p>A module calls <strong>Itcl_PreserveData</strong> on a pointer
<em>ptr</em> allocated by <strong>Itcl_Alloc</strong> to prevent
deallocation of that memory while the module remains interested in
it.</p>
<p>A module calls <strong>Itcl_ReleaseData</strong> on a pointer
<em>ptr</em> previously preserved by <strong>Itcl_PreserveData</strong>
to indicate the module no longer has an interest in the block of memory,
and will not be disturbed by its deallocation.</p>
<p><strong>Itcl_EventuallyFree</strong> is called on a pointer
<em>ptr</em> allocated by <strong>Itcl_Alloc</strong> to register a
deallocation routine <em>fproc</em> to be called when the number of
calls to <strong>Itcl_ReleaseData</strong> on <em>ptr</em> matches the
number of calls to <strong>Itcl_PreserveData</strong> on <em>ptr</em>.
This condition indicates all modules have ended their interest in the
block of memory and a call to <em>fproc</em> with argument <em>ptr</em>
will deallocate the memory that no module needs anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Itcl_Free</strong> is a deallocation routine for a
<em>ptr</em> value allocated by <strong>Itcl_Alloc</strong>. It may be
called on any <em>ptr</em> with no history of an
<strong>Itcl_PreserveData</strong> call unmatched by an
<strong>Itcl_ReleaseData</strong> call. It is best used as an
<em>fproc</em> argument to <strong>Itcl_EventuallyFree</strong> or as a
routine called from within such an <em>fproc</em> routine. It can also
be used to deallocate a <em>ptr</em> value when it can be assured that
value has never been passed to <strong>Itcl_PreserveData</strong> or
<strong>Itcl_EventuallyFree</strong>.</p>
