<p>itcl::find - search for classes and objects</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>itcl::find</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg
...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>find</strong> command is used to find classes and objects
that are available in the current interpreter. Classes and objects are
reported first in the active namespace, then in all other namespaces in
the interpreter.</p>
<p>The <em>option</em> argument determines what action is carried out by
the command. The legal <em>options</em> (which may be abbreviated)
are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>find classes ?</strong><em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of [incr Tcl] classes. Classes in the current
namespace are listed first, followed by classes in all other namespaces
in the interpreter. If the optional <em>pattern</em> is specified, then
the reported names are compared using the rules of the "<strong>string
match</strong>" command, and only matching names are reported.</p>
<p>If a class resides in the current namespace context, this command
reports its simple name--without any qualifiers. However, if the
<em>pattern</em> contains <strong>::</strong> qualifiers, or if the
class resides in another context, this command reports its
fully-qualified name. Therefore, you can use the following command to
obtain a list where all names are fully-qualified:</p>
<pre><code>itcl::find classes ::*</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong>find objects ?</strong><em>pattern</em>?
?<strong>-class</strong> <em>className</em>? ?<strong>-isa</strong>
<em>className</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of [incr Tcl] objects. Objects in the current
namespace are listed first, followed by objects in all other namespaces
in the interpreter. If the optional <em>pattern</em> is specified, then
the reported names are compared using the rules of the "<strong>string
match</strong>" command, and only matching names are reported. If the
optional "<strong>-class</strong>" parameter is specified, this list is
restricted to objects whose most-specific class is <em>className</em>.
If the optional "<strong>-isa</strong>" parameter is specified, this
list is further restricted to objects having the given
<em>className</em> anywhere in their heritage.</p>
<p>If an object resides in the current namespace context, this command
reports its simple name--without any qualifiers. However, if the
<em>pattern</em> contains <strong>::</strong> qualifiers, or if the
object resides in another context, this command reports its
fully-qualified name. Therefore, you can use the following command to
obtain a list where all names are fully-qualified:</p>
<pre><code>itcl::find objects ::*</code></pre>
</dd>
