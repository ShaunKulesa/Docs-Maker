<p>itcl::scope - capture the namespace context for a variable</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>itcl::scope</strong> <em>name</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Creates a scoped value for the specified <em>name</em>, which must be
a variable name. If the <em>name</em> is an instance variable, then the
scope command returns a name which will resolve in any context as an
instance variable belonging to <em>object</em>. The precise format of
this name is an internal detail to Itcl. Use of such a scoped value
makes it possible to use instance variables in conjunction with widgets.
For example, if you have an object with a private variable
<code>x</code>, and you can use <code>x</code> in conjunction with the
<code>-textvariable</code> option of an entry widget. Before itcl3.0,
only common variables could be used in this manner.</p>
<p>If the <em>name</em> is not an instance variable, then it must be a
common variable or a global variable. In that case, the scope command
returns the fully qualified name of the variable, e.g.,
<code>::foo::bar::x</code>.</p>
<p>If the <em>name</em> is not recognized as a variable, the scope
command returns an error.</p>
<p>Ordinary variable names refer to variables in the global namespace. A
scoped value captures a variable name together with its namespace
context in a way that allows it to be referenced properly later. It is
needed, for example, to wrap up variable names when a Tk widget is used
within a namespace:</p>
<pre><code>namespace foo {
    private variable mode 1

    radiobutton .rb1 -text &quot;Mode #1&quot;         -variable [scope mode] -value 1
    pack .rb1

    radiobutton .rb2 -text &quot;Mode #2&quot;         -variable [scope mode] -value 2
    pack .rb2
}</code></pre>
<p>Radiobuttons <code>.rb1</code> and <code>.rb2</code> interact via the
variable "mode" contained in the namespace "foo". The
<strong>scope</strong> command guarantees this by returning the fully
qualified variable name <code>::foo::mode</code>.</p>
<p>You should never attempt to craft your own scoped variable names,
even if you believe you've flawlessly reverse-engineered the encoding.
Instead, you should always use the scope command to generate the
variable name dynamically. Then, you can pass that name to a widget or
to any other bit of code in your program.</p>
