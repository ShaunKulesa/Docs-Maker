<p>itcl::body - change the body for a class method/proc</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>itcl::body</strong>
<em>className</em><strong>::</strong><em>function args body</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>body</strong> command is used outside of an <strong>[incr
Tcl]</strong> class definition to define or redefine the body of a class
method or proc. This facility allows a class definition to have separate
"interface" and "implementation" parts. The "interface" part is a
<strong>class</strong> command with declarations for methods, procs,
instance variables and common variables. The "implementation" part is a
series of <strong>body</strong> and <strong>configbody</strong>
commands. If the "implementation" part is kept in a separate file, it
can be sourced again and again as bugs are fixed, to support interactive
development. When using the "tcl" mode in the <strong>emacs</strong>
editor, the "interface" and "implementation" parts can be kept in the
same file; as bugs are fixed, individual bodies can be highlighted and
sent to the test application.</p>
<p>The name "<em>className</em><strong>::</strong><em>function</em>"
identifies the method/proc being changed.</p>
<p>If an <em>args</em> list was specified when the <em>function</em> was
defined in the class definition, the <em>args</em> list for the
<strong>body</strong> command must match in meaning. Variable names can
change, but the argument lists must have the same required arguments and
the same default values for optional arguments. The special
<strong>args</strong> argument acts as a wildcard when included in the
<em>args</em> list in the class definition; it will match zero or more
arguments of any type when the body is redefined.</p>
<p>If the <em>body</em> string starts with "<strong><span
class="citation" data-cites="*">@*</span><em>", it is treated as the
symbolic name for a C procedure. The </em>args* list has little meaning
for the C procedure, except to document the expected usage. (The C
procedure is not guaranteed to use arguments in this manner.) If
<em>body</em> does not start with "</strong>@**", it is treated as a Tcl
command script. When the function is invoked, command line arguments are
matched against the <em>args</em> list, and local variables are created
to represent each argument. This is the usual behavior for a Tcl-style
proc.</p>
<p>Symbolic names for C procedures are established by registering
procedures via <strong>Itcl_RegisterC()</strong>. This is usually done
in the <strong>Tcl_AppInit()</strong> procedure, which is automatically
called when the interpreter starts up. In the following example, the
procedure <code>My_FooCmd()</code> is registered with the symbolic name
"foo". This procedure can be referenced in the <strong>body</strong>
command as "<code>@foo</code>".</p>
<pre><code>int
Tcl_AppInit(interp)
    Tcl_Interp *interp;     /* Interpreter for application. */
{
    if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }

    if (Itcl_RegisterC(interp, &quot;foo&quot;, My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
}</code></pre>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>In the following example, a "File" class is defined to represent open
files. The method bodies are included below the class definition via the
<strong>body</strong> command. Note that the bodies of the
constructor/destructor must be included in the class definition, but
they can be redefined via the <strong>body</strong> command as well.</p>
<pre><code>itcl::class File {
    private variable fid &quot;&quot;
    constructor {name access} {
        set fid [open $name $access]
    }
    destructor {
        close $fid
    }

    method get {}
    method put {line}
    method eof {}
}

itcl::body File::get {} {
    return [gets $fid]
}
itcl::body File::put {line} {
    puts $fid $line
}
itcl::body File::eof {} {
    return [::eof $fid]
}

#
# See the File class in action:
#
File x /etc/passwd &quot;r&quot;
while {![x eof]} {
    puts &quot;=&gt; [x get]&quot;
}
itcl::delete object x</code></pre>
