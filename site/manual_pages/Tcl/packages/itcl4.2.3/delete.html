<p>itcl::delete - delete things in the interpreter</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>itcl::delete</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg
...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>delete</strong> command is used to delete things in the
interpreter. It is implemented as an ensemble, so extensions can add
their own options and extend the behavior of this command. By default,
the <strong>delete</strong> command handles the destruction of
namespaces.</p>
<p>The <em>option</em> argument determines what action is carried out by
the command. The legal <em>options</em> (which may be abbreviated)
are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>delete class</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deletes one or more <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> classes called
<em>name</em>. This deletes all objects in the class, and all derived
classes as well.</p>
<p>If an error is encountered while destructing an object, it will
prevent the destruction of the class and any remaining objects. To
destroy the entire class without regard for errors, use the
"<strong>delete namespace</strong>" command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>delete object</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deletes one or more <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> objects called
<em>name</em>. An object is deleted by invoking all destructors in its
class hierarchy, in order from most- to least-specific. If all
destructors are successful, data associated with the object is deleted
and the <em>name</em> is removed as a command from the interpreter.</p>
<p>If the access command for an object resides in another namespace,
then its qualified name can be used:</p>
<pre><code>itcl::delete object foo::bar::x</code></pre>
<p>If an error is encountered while destructing an object, the
<strong>delete</strong> command is aborted and the object remains alive.
To destroy an object without regard for errors, use the
"<strong>rename</strong>" command to destroy the object access
command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>delete namespace</strong> <em>name</em>
?<em>name...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deletes one or more namespaces called <em>name</em>. This deletes all
commands and variables in the namespace, and deletes all child
namespaces as well. When a namespace is deleted, it is automatically
removed from the import lists of all other namespaces.</p>
