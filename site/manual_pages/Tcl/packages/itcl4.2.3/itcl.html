<p>itcl - object-oriented extensions to Tcl</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> provides object-oriented extensions to
Tcl, much as C++ provides object-oriented extensions to C. The emphasis
of this work, however, is not to create a whiz-bang object-oriented
programming environment. Rather, it is to support more structured
programming practices in Tcl without changing the flavor of the
language. More than anything else, <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> provides
a means of encapsulating related procedures together with their shared
data in a namespace that is hidden from the outside world. It encourages
better programming by promoting the object-oriented "library" mindset.
It also allows for code re-use through inheritance.</p>
<h1 id="classes">CLASSES</h1>
<p>The fundamental construct in <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> is the class
definition. Each class acts as a template for actual objects that can be
created. Each object has its own unique bundle of data, which contains
instances of the "variables" defined in the class. Special procedures
called "methods" are used to manipulate individual objects. Methods are
just like the operations that are used to manipulate Tk widgets. The
"<strong>button</strong>" widget, for example, has methods such as
"flash" and "invoke" that cause a particular button to blink and invoke
its command.</p>
<p>Within the body of a method, the "variables" defined in the class are
automatically available. They need not be declared with anything like
the <strong>global</strong> command. Within another class method, a
method can be invoked like any other command-simply by using its name.
From any other context, the method name must be prefaced by an object
name, which provides a context for the data that the method can
access.</p>
<p>Each class has its own namespace containing things that are common to
all objects which belong to the class. For example, "common" data
members are shared by all objects in the class. They are global
variables that exist in the class namespace, but since they are included
in the class definition, they need not be declared using the
<strong>global</strong> command; they are automatically available to any
code executing in the class context. A class can also create ordinary
global variables, but these must be declared using the
<strong>global</strong> command each time they are used.</p>
<p>Classes can also have ordinary procedures declared as "procs". Within
another class method or proc, a proc can be invoked like any other
command-simply by using its name. From any other context, the procedure
name should be qualified with the class namespace like
"<em>className</em><strong>::</strong><em>proc</em>". Class procs
execute in the class context, and therefore have automatic access to all
"common" data members. However, they cannot access object-specific
"variables", since they are invoked without reference to any specific
object. They are usually used to perform generic operations which affect
all objects belonging to the class.</p>
<p>Each of the elements in a class can be declared "public", "protected"
or "private". Public elements can be accessed by the class, by derived
classes (other classes that inherit this class), and by external clients
that use the class. Protected elements can be accessed by the class, and
by derived classes. Private elements are only accessible in the class
where they are defined.</p>
<p>The "public" elements within a class define its interface to the
external world. Public methods define the operations that can be used to
manipulate an object. Public variables are recognized as configuration
options by the "configure" and "cget" methods that are built into each
class. The public interface says <em>what</em> an object will do but not
<em>how</em> it will do it. Protected and private members, along with
the bodies of class methods and procs, provide the implementation
details. Insulating the application developer from these details leaves
the class designer free to change them at any time, without warning, and
without affecting programs that rely on the class. It is precisely this
encapsulation that makes object-oriented programs easier to understand
and maintain.</p>
<p>The fact that <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> objects look like Tk
widgets is no accident. <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> was designed this
way, to blend naturally into a Tcl/Tk application. But <strong>[incr
Tcl]</strong> extends the Tk paradigm from being merely object-based to
being fully object-oriented. An object-oriented system supports
inheritance, allowing classes to share common behaviors by inheriting
them from an ancestor or base class. Having a base class as a common
abstraction allows a programmer to treat related classes in a similar
manner. For example, a toaster and a blender perform different
(specialized) functions, but both share the abstraction of being
appliances. By abstracting common behaviors into a base class, code can
be <em>shared</em> rather than <em>copied</em>. The resulting
application is easier to understand and maintain, and derived classes
(e.g., specialized appliances) can be added or removed more easily.</p>
<p>This description was merely a brief overview of object-oriented
programming and <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong>. A more tutorial
introduction is presented in the paper included with this distribution.
See the <strong>class</strong> command for more details on creating and
using classes.</p>
<h1 id="namespaces">NAMESPACES</h1>
<p><strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> now includes a complete namespace
facility. A namespace is a collection of commands and global variables
that is kept apart from the usual global scope. This allows Tcl code
libraries to be packaged in a well-defined manner, and prevents unwanted
interactions with other libraries. A namespace can also have child
namespaces within it, so one library can contain its own private copy of
many other libraries. A namespace can also be used to wrap up a group of
related classes. The global scope (named "<code>::</code>") is the root
namespace for an interpreter; all other namespaces are contained within
it.</p>

and using namespaces.</p>
<h1 id="mega-widgets">MEGA-WIDGETS</h1>
<p>Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using Tk
widgets as component parts, usually without any C code. A
fileselectionbox, for example, may have a few listboxes, some entry
widgets and some control buttons. These individual widgets are put
together in a way that makes them act like one big widget.</p>
<p><strong>[incr Tk]</strong> is a framework for building mega-widgets.
It uses <strong>[incr Tcl]</strong> to support the object paradigm, and
adds base classes which provide default widget behaviors. See the
<strong>itk</strong> man page for more details.</p>
<p><strong>[incr Widgets]</strong> is a library of mega-widgets built
using <strong>[incr Tk]</strong>. It contains more than 30 different
widget classes that can be used right out of the box to build Tcl/Tk
applications. Each widget class has its own man page describing the
features available.</p>
