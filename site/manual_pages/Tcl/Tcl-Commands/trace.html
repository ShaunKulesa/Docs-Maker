<p>trace - Monitor variable accesses, command usages and command
executions</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>trace</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command causes Tcl commands to be executed whenever certain
operations are invoked. The legal <em>option</em>s (which may be
abbreviated) are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>trace add</strong> <em>type name ops ?args?</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Where <em>type</em> is <strong>command</strong>,
<strong>execution</strong>, or <strong>variable</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>trace add command</strong> <em>name ops
commandPrefix</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for <em>commandPrefix</em> to be executed (with additional
arguments) whenever command <em>name</em> is modified in one of the ways
given by the list <em>ops</em>. <em>Name</em> will be resolved using the
usual namespace resolution rules used by commands. If the command does
not exist, an error will be thrown.</p>
<p><em>Ops</em> indicates which operations are of interest, and is a
list of one or more of the following items:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>rename</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> whenever the traced command is renamed.
Note that renaming to the empty string is considered deletion, and will
not be traced with</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>delete</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> when the traced command is deleted.
Commands can be deleted explicitly by using the <strong>rename</strong>
command to rename the command to an empty string. Commands are also
deleted when the interpreter is deleted, but traces will not be invoked
because there is no interpreter in which to execute them.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a
number of arguments are appended to <em>commandPrefix</em> so that the
actual command is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>commandPrefix oldName newName op</code></pre>
<p><em>OldName</em> and <em>newName</em> give the traced command's
current (old) name, and the name to which it is being renamed (the empty
string if this is a operation). <em>Op</em> indicates what operation is
being performed on the command, and is one of <strong>rename</strong> or
<strong>delete</strong> as defined above. The trace operation cannot be
used to stop a command from being deleted. Tcl will always remove the
command once the trace is complete. Recursive renaming or deleting will
not cause further traces of the same type to be evaluated, so a delete
trace which itself deletes the command, or a rename trace which itself
renames the command will not cause further trace evaluations to occur.
Both <em>oldName</em> and <em>newName</em> are fully qualified with any
namespace(s) in which they appear.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>trace add execution</strong> <em>name ops
commandPrefix</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for <em>commandPrefix</em> to be executed (with additional
arguments) whenever command <em>name</em> is executed, with traces
occurring at the points indicated by the list <em>ops</em>.
<em>Name</em> will be resolved using the usual namespace resolution
rules used by commands. If the command does not exist, an error will be
thrown.</p>
<p><em>Ops</em> indicates which operations are of interest, and is a
list of one or more of the following items:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>enter</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> whenever the command <em>name</em> is
executed, just before the actual execution takes place.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>leave</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> whenever the command <em>name</em> is
executed, just after the actual execution takes place.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>enterstep</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> for every Tcl command which is executed
from the start of the execution of the procedure <em>name</em> until
that procedure finishes. <em>CommandPrefix</em> is invoked just before
the actual execution of the Tcl command being reported takes place. For
example if we have then an <em>enterstep</em> trace would be invoked
just before is executed. Setting an <em>enterstep</em> trace on a
command <em>name</em> that does not refer to a procedure will not result
in an error and is simply ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>leavestep</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> for every Tcl command which is executed
from the start of the execution of the procedure <em>name</em> until
that procedure finishes. <em>CommandPrefix</em> is invoked just after
the actual execution of the Tcl command being reported takes place.
Setting a <em>leavestep</em> trace on a command <em>name</em> that does
not refer to a procedure will not result in an error and is simply
ignored.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a
number of arguments are appended to <em>commandPrefix</em> so that the
actual command is as follows:</p>
<p>For <strong>enter</strong> and <strong>enterstep</strong>
operations:</p>
<pre><code>commandPrefix command-string op</code></pre>
<p><em>Command-string</em> gives the complete current command being
executed (the traced command for a <strong>enter</strong> operation, an
arbitrary command for a <strong>enterstep</strong> operation), including
all arguments in their fully expanded form. <em>Op</em> indicates what
operation is being performed on the command execution, and is one of
<strong>enter</strong> or <strong>enterstep</strong> as defined above.
The trace operation can be used to stop the command from executing, by
deleting the command in question. Of course when the command is
subsequently executed, an error will occur.</p>
<p>For <strong>leave</strong> and <strong>leavestep</strong>
operations:</p>
<pre><code>commandPrefix command-string code result op</code></pre>
<p><em>Command-string</em> gives the complete current command being
executed (the traced command for a <strong>enter</strong> operation, an
arbitrary command for a <strong>enterstep</strong> operation), including
all arguments in their fully expanded form. <em>Code</em> gives the
result code of that execution, and <em>result</em> the result string.
<em>Op</em> indicates what operation is being performed on the command
execution, and is one of <strong>leave</strong> or
<strong>leavestep</strong> as defined above. Note that the creation of
many <strong>enterstep</strong> or <strong>leavestep</strong> traces can
lead to unintuitive results, since the invoked commands from one trace
can themselves lead to further command invocations for other traces.</p>
<p><em>CommandPrefix</em> executes in the same context as the code that
invoked the traced operation: thus the <em>commandPrefix</em>, if
invoked from a procedure, will have access to the same local variables
as code in the procedure. This context may be different than the context
in which the trace was created. If <em>commandPrefix</em> invokes a
procedure (which it normally does) then the procedure will have to use
<strong>upvar</strong> or <strong>uplevel</strong> commands if it wishes
to access the local variables of the code which invoked the trace
operation.</p>
<p>While <em>commandPrefix</em> is executing during an execution trace,
traces on <em>name</em> are temporarily disabled. This allows the
<em>commandPrefix</em> to execute <em>name</em> in its body without
invoking any other traces again. If an error occurs while executing the
<em>commandPrefix</em>, then the command <em>name</em> as a whole will
return that same error.</p>
<p>When multiple traces are set on <em>name</em>, then for
<em>enter</em> and <em>enterstep</em> operations, the traced commands
are invoked in the reverse order of how the traces were originally
created; and for <em>leave</em> and <em>leavestep</em> operations, the
traced commands are invoked in the original order of creation.</p>
<p>The behavior of execution traces is currently undefined for a command
<em>name</em> imported into another namespace.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>trace add variable</strong> <em>name ops
commandPrefix</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrange for <em>commandPrefix</em> to be executed whenever variable
<em>name</em> is accessed in one of the ways given by the list
<em>ops</em>. <em>Name</em> may refer to a normal variable, an element
of an array, or to an array as a whole (i.e.Â <em>name</em> may be just
the name of an array, with no parenthesized index). If <em>name</em>
refers to a whole array, then <em>commandPrefix</em> is invoked whenever
any element of the array is manipulated. If the variable does not exist,
it will be created but will not be given a value, so it will be visible
to <strong>namespace which</strong> queries, but not to <strong>info
exists</strong> queries.</p>
<p><em>Ops</em> indicates which operations are of interest, and is a
list of one or more of the following items:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>array</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> whenever the variable is accessed or
modified via the <strong>array</strong> command, provided that
<em>name</em> is not a scalar variable at the time that the
<strong>array</strong> command is invoked. If <em>name</em> is a scalar
variable, the access via the <strong>array</strong> command will not
trigger the trace.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>read</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> whenever the variable is read.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>write</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> whenever the variable is written.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>unset</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke <em>commandPrefix</em> whenever the variable is unset.
Variables can be unset explicitly with the <strong>unset</strong>
command, or implicitly when procedures return (all of their local
variables are unset). Variables are also unset when interpreters are
deleted, but traces will not be invoked because there is no interpreter
in which to execute them.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the trace triggers, three arguments are appended to
<em>commandPrefix</em> so that the actual command is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>commandPrefix name1 name2 op</code></pre>
<p><em>Name1</em> and <em>name2</em> give the name(s) for the variable
being accessed: if the variable is a scalar then <em>name1</em> gives
the variable's name and <em>name2</em> is an empty string; if the
variable is an array element then <em>name1</em> gives the name of the
array and name2 gives the index into the array; if an entire array is
being deleted and the trace was registered on the overall array, rather
than a single element, then <em>name1</em> gives the array name and
<em>name2</em> is an empty string. <em>Name1</em> and <em>name2</em> are
not necessarily the same as the name used in the <strong>trace
variable</strong> command: the <strong>upvar</strong> command allows a
procedure to reference a variable under a different name. <em>Op</em>
indicates what operation is being performed on the variable, and is one
of <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>, or
<strong>unset</strong> as defined above.</p>
<p><em>CommandPrefix</em> executes in the same context as the code that
invoked the traced operation: if the variable was accessed as part of a
Tcl procedure, then <em>commandPrefix</em> will have access to the same
local variables as code in the procedure. This context may be different
than the context in which the trace was created. If
<em>commandPrefix</em> invokes a procedure (which it normally does) then
the procedure will have to use <strong>upvar</strong> or
<strong>uplevel</strong> if it wishes to access the traced variable.
Note also that <em>name1</em> may not necessarily be the same as the
name used to set the trace on the variable; differences can occur if the
access is made through a variable defined with the
<strong>upvar</strong> command.</p>
<p>For read and write traces, <em>commandPrefix</em> can modify the
variable to affect the result of the traced operation. If
<em>commandPrefix</em> modifies the value of a variable during a read or
write trace, then the new value will be returned as the result of the
traced operation. The return value from <em>commandPrefix</em> is
ignored except that if it returns an error of any sort then the traced
operation also returns an error with the same error message returned by
the trace command (this mechanism can be used to implement read-only
variables, for example). For write traces, <em>commandPrefix</em> is
invoked after the variable's value has been changed; it can write a new
value into the variable to override the original value specified in the
write operation. To implement read-only variables,
<em>commandPrefix</em> will have to restore the old value of the
variable.</p>
<p>While <em>commandPrefix</em> is executing during a read or write
trace, traces on the variable are temporarily disabled. This means that
reads and writes invoked by <em>commandPrefix</em> will occur directly,
without invoking <em>commandPrefix</em> (or any other traces) again.
However, if <em>commandPrefix</em> unsets the variable then unset traces
will be invoked.</p>
<p>When an unset trace is invoked, the variable has already been
deleted: it will appear to be undefined with no traces. If an unset
occurs because of a procedure return, then the trace will be invoked in
the variable context of the procedure being returned to: the stack frame
of the returning procedure will no longer exist. Traces are not disabled
during unset traces, so if an unset trace command creates a new trace
and accesses the variable, the trace will be invoked. Any errors in
unset traces are ignored.</p>
<p>If there are multiple traces on a variable they are invoked in order
of creation, most-recent first. If one trace returns an error, then no
further traces are invoked for the variable. If an array element has a
trace set, and there is also a trace set on the array as a whole, the
trace on the overall array is invoked before the one on the element.</p>
<p>Once created, the trace remains in effect either until the trace is
removed with the <strong>trace remove variable</strong> command
described below, until the variable is unset, or until the interpreter
is deleted. Unsetting an element of array will remove any traces on that
element, but will not remove traces on the overall array.</p>
<p>This command returns an empty string.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>trace remove command</strong> <em>name opList

<dd>
<p>If there is a trace set on command <em>name</em> with the operations
and command given by <em>opList</em> and <em>commandPrefix</em>, then
the trace is removed, so that <em>commandPrefix</em> will never again be
invoked. Returns an empty string. If <em>name</em> does not exist, the
command will throw an error.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>trace info command</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing one element for each trace currently set on

containing two elements, which are the <em>opList</em> and
<em>commandPrefix</em> associated with the trace. If <em>name</em> does
not have any traces set, then the result of the command will be an empty
string. If <em>name</em> does not exist, the command will throw an
error.</p>

string. If <em>name</em> does not exist, the command will throw an
error.</p>

</dl>
<p>For backwards compatibility, three other subcommands are
available:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>trace variable</strong> <em>name ops command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is equivalent to <strong>trace add variable</strong> <em>name
ops command</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>trace vdelete</strong> <em>name ops command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is equivalent to <strong>trace remove variable</strong> <em>name
ops command</em></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>trace vinfo</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is equivalent to <strong>trace info variable</strong>
<em>name</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>These subcommands are deprecated and will likely be removed in a
future version of Tcl. They use an older syntax in which
<strong>array</strong>, <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>,
<strong>unset</strong> are replaced by <strong>a</strong>,
<strong>r</strong>, <strong>w</strong> and <strong>u</strong>
respectively, and the <em>ops</em> argument is not a list, but simply a
string concatenation of the operations, such as
<strong>rwua</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Print a message whenever either of the global variables
<strong>foo</strong> and <strong>bar</strong> are updated, even if they
have a different local name at the time (which can be done with the
<strong>upvar</strong> command):</p>
<pre><code>proc tracer {varname args} {
    upvar #0 $varname var
    puts &quot;$varname was updated to be \&quot;$var\&quot;&quot;
}
trace add variable foo write &quot;tracer foo&quot;
trace add variable bar write &quot;tracer bar&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Ensure that the global variable <strong>foobar</strong> always
contains the product of the global variables <strong>foo</strong> and
<strong>bar</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>proc doMult args {
    global foo bar foobar
    set foobar [expr {$foo * $bar}]
}
trace add variable foo write doMult

trace add execution x enterstep report
x
  â report y enterstep
    report z enterstep
