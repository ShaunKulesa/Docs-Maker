<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>upvar - Create link to variable in a different stack frame</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>upvar</strong> ?<em>level</em>? <em>otherVar myVar</em>
?<em>otherVar myVar</em> ...?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command arranges for one or more local variables in the current
procedure to refer to variables in an enclosing procedure call or to
global variables. <em>Level</em> may have any of the forms permitted for
the <strong>uplevel</strong> command, and may be omitted (it defaults to
<strong>1</strong>). For each <em>otherVar</em> argument,
<strong>upvar</strong> makes the variable by that name in the procedure
frame given by <em>level</em> (or at global level, if <em>level</em> is
<strong>#0</strong>) accessible in the current procedure by the name
given in the corresponding <em>myVar</em> argument. The variable named
by <em>otherVar</em> need not exist at the time of the call; it will be
created the first time <em>myVar</em> is referenced, just like an
ordinary variable. There must not exist a variable by the name
<em>myVar</em> at the time <strong>upvar</strong> is invoked.
<em>MyVar</em> is always treated as the name of a variable, not an array
element. An error is returned if the name looks like an array element,
such as <strong>a(b)</strong>. <em>OtherVar</em> may refer to a scalar
variable, an array, or an array element. <strong>Upvar</strong> returns
an empty string.</p>
<p>The <strong>upvar</strong> command simplifies the implementation of
call-by-name procedure calling and also makes it easier to build new
control constructs as Tcl procedures. For example, consider the
following procedure:</p>
<pre><code>proc add2 name {
    upvar $name x
    set x [expr {$x + 2}]
}</code></pre>
<p>If <em>add2</em> is invoked with an argument giving the name of a
variable, it adds two to the value of that variable. Although
<em>add2</em> could have been implemented using <strong>uplevel</strong>
instead of <strong>upvar</strong>, <strong>upvar</strong> makes it
simpler for <em>add2</em> to access the variable in the caller's
procedure frame.</p>
<p><strong>namespace eval</strong> is another way (besides procedure
calls) that the Tcl naming context can change. It adds a call frame to
the stack to represent the namespace context. This means each
<strong>namespace eval</strong> command counts as another call level for
<strong>uplevel</strong> and <strong>upvar</strong> commands. For
example, <strong>info level</strong> <strong>1</strong> will return a
list describing a command that is either the outermost procedure call or
the outermost <strong>namespace eval</strong> command. Also,
<strong>uplevel #0</strong> evaluates a script at top-level in the
outermost namespace (the global namespace).</p>
<p>If an upvar variable is unset (e.g.Â <strong>x</strong> in
<strong>add2</strong> above), the <strong>unset</strong> operation
affects the variable it is linked to, not the upvar variable. There is
no way to unset an upvar variable except by exiting the procedure in
which it is defined. However, it is possible to retarget an upvar
variable by executing another <strong>upvar</strong> command.</p>
<h1 id="traces-and-upvar">TRACES AND UPVAR</h1>
<p>Upvar interacts with traces in a straightforward but possibly
unexpected manner. If a variable trace is defined on <em>otherVar</em>,
that trace will be triggered by actions involving <em>myVar</em>.
However, the trace procedure will be passed the name of <em>myVar</em>,
rather than the name of <em>otherVar</em>. Thus, the output of the
following code will be rather than</p>
<pre><code>proc traceproc { name index op } {
    puts $name
}
proc setByUpvar { name value } {
    upvar $name localVar
    set localVar $value
}
set originalVar 1
trace variable originalVar w traceproc
setByUpvar originalVar 2</code></pre>
<p>If <em>otherVar</em> refers to an element of an array, then variable
traces set for the entire array will not be invoked when <em>myVar</em>
is accessed (but traces on the particular element will still be
invoked). In particular, if the array is <strong>env</strong>, then
changes made to <em>myVar</em> will not be passed to subprocesses
correctly.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>A <strong>decr</strong> command that works like <strong>incr</strong>
except it subtracts the value from the variable instead of adding
it:</p>
<pre><code>proc decr {varName {decrement 1}} {
    upvar 1 $varName var
    incr var [expr {-$decrement}]
}</code></pre>
