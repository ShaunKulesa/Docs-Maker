<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command is used to delay execution of the program or to execute
a command in background sometime in the future. It has several forms,
depending on the first argument to the command:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>after</strong> <em>ms</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Ms</em> must be an integer giving a time in milliseconds. A
negative number is treated as 0. The command sleeps for <em>ms</em>
milliseconds and then returns. While the command is sleeping the
application does not respond to events.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>after</strong> <em>ms</em> ?<em>script script script
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form the command returns immediately, but it arranges for a
Tcl command to be executed <em>ms</em> milliseconds later as an event
handler. The command will be executed exactly once, at the given time.
The delayed command is formed by concatenating all the <em>script</em>
arguments in the same fashion as the <strong>concat</strong> command.
The command will be executed at global level (outside the context of any
Tcl procedure). If an error occurs while executing the delayed command
then the background error will be reported by the command registered
with <strong>interp bgerror</strong>. The <strong>after</strong> command
returns an identifier that can be used to cancel the delayed command
using <strong>after cancel</strong>. A <em>ms</em> value of 0 (or
negative) queues the event immediately with priority over other event
types (if not installed withn an event proc, which will wait for next
round of events).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>after cancel</strong> <em>id</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Cancels the execution of a delayed command that was previously
scheduled. <em>Id</em> indicates which command should be canceled; it
must have been the return value from a previous <strong>after</strong>
command. If the command given by <em>id</em> has already been executed
then the <strong>after cancel</strong> command has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>after cancel</strong> <em>script script ...</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command also cancels the execution of a delayed command. The
<em>script</em> arguments are concatenated together with space
separators (just as in the <strong>concat</strong> command). If there is
a pending command that matches the string, it is canceled and will never
be executed; if no such command is currently pending then the
<strong>after cancel</strong> command has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>after idle</strong> <em>script</em> ?<em>script script
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Concatenates the <em>script</em> arguments together with space
separators (just as in the <strong>concat</strong> command), and
arranges for the resulting script to be evaluated later as an idle
callback. The script will be run exactly once, the next time the event
loop is entered and there are no events to process. The command returns
an identifier that can be used to cancel the delayed command using
<strong>after cancel</strong>. If an error occurs while executing the
script then the background error will be reported by the command
registered with <strong>interp bgerror</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>after info</strong> ?<em>id</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command returns information about existing event handlers. If no
<em>id</em> argument is supplied, the command returns a list of the
identifiers for all existing event handlers created by the
<strong>after</strong> command for this interpreter. If <em>id</em> is
supplied, it specifies an existing handler; <em>id</em> must have been
the return value from some previous call to <strong>after</strong> and
it must not have triggered yet or been canceled. In this case the
command returns a list with two elements. The first element of the list
is the script associated with <em>id</em>, and the second element is
either <strong>idle</strong> or <strong>timer</strong> to indicate what
kind of event handler it is.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>after</strong> <em>ms</em> and <strong>after
idle</strong> forms of the command assume that the application is event
driven: the delayed commands will not be executed unless the application
enters the event loop. In applications that are not normally
event-driven, such as <strong>tclsh</strong>, the event loop can be
entered with the <strong>vwait</strong> and <strong>update</strong>
commands.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This defines a command to make Tcl do nothing at all for <em>N</em>
seconds:</p>
<pre><code>proc sleep {N} {
    after [expr {int($N * 1000)}]
}</code></pre>
<p>This arranges for the command <em>wake_up</em> to be run in eight
hours (providing the event loop is active at that time):</p>
<pre><code>after [expr {1000 * 60 * 60 * 8}] wake_up</code></pre>
<p>The following command can be used to do long-running calculations (as
represented here by <em>::my_calc::one_step</em>, which is assumed to
return a boolean indicating whether another step should be performed) in
a step-by-step fashion, though the calculation itself needs to be
arranged so it can work step-wise. This technique is extra careful to
ensure that the event loop is not starved by the rescheduling of
processing steps (arranging for the next step to be done using an
already-triggered timer event only when the event queue has been
drained) and is useful when you want to ensure that a Tk GUI remains
responsive during a slow task.</p>
<pre><code>proc doOneStep {} {
    if {[::my_calc::one_step]} {
        after idle [list after 0 doOneStep]
    }
}
doOneStep</code></pre>
