<p>subst - Perform backslash, command, and variable substitutions</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>subst</strong> ?<strong>-nobackslashes</strong>?
?<strong>-nocommands</strong>? ?<strong>-novariables</strong>?
<em>string</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command performs variable substitutions, command substitutions,
and backslash substitutions on its <em>string</em> argument and returns
the fully-substituted result. The substitutions are performed in exactly
the same way as for Tcl commands. As a result, the <em>string</em>
argument is actually substituted twice, once by the Tcl parser in the
usual fashion for Tcl commands, and again by the <em>subst</em>
command.</p>
<p>If any of the <strong>-nobackslashes</strong>,
<strong>-nocommands</strong>, or <strong>-novariables</strong> are
specified, then the corresponding substitutions are not performed. For
example, if <strong>-nocommands</strong> is specified, command
substitution is not performed: open and close brackets are treated as
ordinary characters with no special interpretation.</p>
<p>Note that the substitution of one kind can include substitution of
other kinds. For example, even when the <strong>-novariables</strong>
option is specified, command substitution is performed without
restriction. This means that any variable substitution necessary to
complete the command substitution will still take place. Likewise, any
command substitution necessary to complete a variable substitution will
take place, even when <strong>-nocommands</strong> is specified. See the
<strong>EXAMPLES</strong> below.</p>
<p>If an error occurs during substitution, then <strong>subst</strong>
will return that error. If a break exception occurs during command or
variable substitution, the result of the whole substitution will be the
string (as substituted) up to the start of the substitution that raised
the exception. If a continue exception occurs during the evaluation of a
command or variable substitution, an empty string will be substituted
for that entire command or variable substitution (as long as it is
well-formed Tcl.) If a return exception occurs, or any other return code
is returned during command or variable substitution, then the returned
value is substituted for that substitution. See the
<strong>EXAMPLES</strong> below. In this way, all exceptional return
codes are by <strong>subst</strong>. The <strong>subst</strong> command
itself will either return an error, or will complete successfully.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>When it performs its substitutions, <em>subst</em> does not give any
special treatment to double quotes or curly braces (except within
command substitutions) so the script</p>
<pre><code>set a 44
subst {xyz {$a}}</code></pre>
<p>returns not and the script</p>
<pre><code>set a &quot;p\} q \{r&quot;
subst {xyz {$a}}</code></pre>
<p>returns not</p>
<p>When command substitution is performed, it includes any variable
substitution necessary to evaluate the script.</p>
<pre><code>set a 44
subst -novariables {$a [format $a]}</code></pre>
<p>returns not Similarly, when variable substitution is performed, it
includes any command substitution necessary to retrieve the value of the
variable.</p>
<pre><code>proc b {} {return c}
array set a {c c [b] tricky}
subst -nocommands {[b] $a([b])}</code></pre>
<p>returns not</p>
<p>The continue and break exceptions allow command substitutions to
prevent substitution of the rest of the command substitution and the
rest of <em>string</em> respectively, giving script authors more options
when processing text using <em>subst</em>. For example, the script</p>
<pre><code>subst {abc,[break],def}</code></pre>
<p>returns not and the script</p>
<pre><code>subst {abc,[continue;expr {1+2}],def}</code></pre>
<p>returns not</p>
<p>Other exceptional return codes substitute the returned value</p>
<pre><code>subst {abc,[return foo;expr {1+2}],def}</code></pre>
<p>returns not and</p>
<pre><code>subst {abc,[return -code 10 foo;expr {1+2}],def}</code></pre>
<p>also returns not</p>
