<p>open - Open a file-based or command pipeline channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>open</strong> <em>fileName</em><br />
<strong>open</strong> <em>fileName access</em><br />
<strong>open</strong> <em>fileName access permissions</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command opens a file, serial port, or command pipeline and
returns a channel identifier that may be used in future invocations of
commands like <strong>read</strong>, <strong>puts</strong>, and
<strong>close</strong>. If the first character of <em>fileName</em> is
not <strong>|</strong> then the command opens a file: <em>fileName</em>
gives the name of the file to open, and it must conform to the
conventions described in the <strong>filename</strong> manual entry.</p>
<p>The <em>access</em> argument, if present, indicates the way in which
the file (or command pipeline) is to be accessed. In the first form
<em>access</em> may have any of the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>r</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for reading only; the file must already exist. This is
the default value if <em>access</em> is not specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>r+</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for both reading and writing; the file must already
exist.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>w</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for writing only. Truncate it if it exists. If it does
not exist, create a new file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>w+</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for reading and writing. Truncate it if it exists. If
it does not exist, create a new file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>a</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, create a
new empty file. Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to
each write.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>a+</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for reading and writing. If the file does not exist,
create a new empty file. Set the initial access position to the end of
the file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of the legal <em>access</em> values above may have the character
<strong>b</strong> added as the second or third character in the value
to indicate that the opened channel should be configured as if with the
<strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-translation binary</strong> option,
making the channel suitable for reading or writing of binary data.</p>
<p>In the second form, <em>access</em> consists of a list of any of the
following flags, most of which have the standard POSIX meanings. One of
the flags must be either <strong>RDONLY</strong>,
<strong>WRONLY</strong> or <strong>RDWR</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>RDONLY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for reading only.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>WRONLY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for writing only.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>RDWR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the file for both reading and writing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>APPEND</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to each write.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>BINARY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Configure the opened channel with the <strong>-translation
binary</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CREAT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Create the file if it does not already exist (without this flag it is
an error for the file not to exist).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EXCL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>CREAT</strong> is also specified, an error is returned if
the file already exists.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NOCTTY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the file is a terminal device, this flag prevents the file from
becoming the controlling terminal of the process.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NONBLOCK</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prevents the process from blocking while opening the file, and
possibly in subsequent I/O operations. The exact behavior of this flag
is system- and device-dependent; its use is discouraged (it is better to
use the <strong>fconfigure</strong> command to put a file in nonblocking
mode). For details refer to your system documentation on the
<strong>open</strong> system call's <strong>O_NONBLOCK</strong>
flag.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TRUNC</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the file exists it is truncated to zero length.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If a new file is created as part of opening it, <em>permissions</em>
(an integer) is used to set the permissions for the new file in
conjunction with the process's file mode creation mask.
<em>Permissions</em> defaults to 0666.</p>
<h1 id="command-pipelines">COMMAND PIPELINES</h1>
<p>If the first character of <em>fileName</em> is then the remaining
characters of <em>fileName</em> are treated as a list of arguments that
describe a command pipeline to invoke, in the same style as the
arguments for <strong>exec</strong>. In this case, the channel
identifier returned by <strong>open</strong> may be used to write to the
command's input pipe or read from its output pipe, depending on the
value of <em>access</em>. If write-only access is used (e.g.
<em>access</em> is then standard output for the pipeline is directed to
the current standard output unless overridden by the command. If
read-only access is used (e.g. <em>access</em> is standard input for the
pipeline is taken from the current standard input unless overridden by
the command. The id of the spawned process is accessible through the
<strong>pid</strong> command, using the channel id returned by
<strong>open</strong> as argument.</p>
<p>If the command (or one of the commands) executed in the command
pipeline returns an error (according to the definition in
<strong>exec</strong>), a Tcl error is generated when
<strong>close</strong> is called on the channel unless the pipeline is
in non-blocking mode then no exit status is returned (a silent
<strong>close</strong> with -blocking 0).</p>
<p>It is often useful to use the <strong>fileevent</strong> command with
pipelines so other processing may happen at the same time as running the
command in the background.</p>
<h1 id="serial-communications">SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS</h1>
<p>If <em>fileName</em> refers to a serial port, then the specified
serial port is opened and initialized in a platform-dependent manner.
Acceptable values for the <em>fileName</em> to use to open a serial port
are described in the PORTABILITY ISSUES section.</p>
<p>The <strong>fconfigure</strong> command can be used to query and set
additional configuration options specific to serial ports (where
supported):</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-mode</strong>
<em>baud</em><strong>,</strong><em>parity</em><strong>,</strong><em>data</em><strong>,</strong><em>stop</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is a set of 4 comma-separated values: the baud rate,
parity, number of data bits, and number of stop bits for this serial
port. The <em>baud</em> rate is a simple integer that specifies the
connection speed. <em>Parity</em> is one of the following letters:
<strong>n</strong>, <strong>o</strong>, <strong>e</strong>,
<strong>m</strong>, <strong>s</strong>; respectively signifying the
parity options of or <em>Data</em> is the number of data bits and should
be an integer from 5 to 8, while <em>stop</em> is the number of stop
bits and should be the integer 1 or 2.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-handshake</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup automatic handshake
control. Note that not all handshake types maybe supported by your
operating system. The <em>type</em> parameter is case-independent.</p>
<p>If <em>type</em> is <strong>none</strong> then any handshake is
switched off. <strong>rtscts</strong> activates hardware handshake.
Hardware handshake signals are described below. For software handshake
<strong>xonxoff</strong> the handshake characters can be redefined with
<strong>-xchar</strong>. An additional hardware handshake
<strong>dtrdsr</strong> is available only under Windows. There is no
default handshake configuration, the initial value depends on your
operating system settings. The <strong>-handshake</strong> option cannot
be queried.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-queue</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows and Unix). The <strong>-queue</strong> option can only be
queried. It returns a list of two integers representing the current
number of bytes in the input and output queue respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-timeout</strong> <em>msec</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to set the timeout for
blocking read operations. It specifies the maximum interval between the
reception of two bytes in milliseconds. For Unix systems the granularity
is 100 milliseconds. The <strong>-timeout</strong> option does not
affect write operations or nonblocking reads. This option cannot be
queried.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-ttycontrol</strong> <em>{signal boolean signal boolean
...}</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup the handshake output
lines (see below) permanently or to send a BREAK over the serial line.
The <em>signal</em> names are case-independent. <strong>{RTS 1 DTR
0}</strong> sets the RTS output to high and the DTR output to low. The
BREAK condition (see below) is enabled and disabled with <strong>{BREAK
1}</strong> and <strong>{BREAK 0}</strong> respectively. It is not a
good idea to change the <strong>RTS</strong> (or <strong>DTR</strong>)
signal with active hardware handshake <strong>rtscts</strong> (or
<strong>dtrdsr</strong>). The result is unpredictable. The
<strong>-ttycontrol</strong> option cannot be queried.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-ttystatus</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows and Unix). The <strong>-ttystatus</strong> option can only
be queried. It returns the current modem status and handshake input
signals (see below). The result is a list of signal,value pairs with a
fixed order, e.g. <strong>{CTS 1 DSR 0 RING 1 DCD 0}</strong>. The
<em>signal</em> names are returned upper case.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-xchar</strong> <em>{xonChar xoffChar}</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to query or change the
software handshake characters. Normally the operating system default
should be DC1 (0x11) and DC3 (0x13) representing the ASCII standard XON
and XOFF characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-pollinterval</strong> <em>msec</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows only). This option is used to set the maximum time between
polling for fileevents. This affects the time interval between checking
for events throughout the Tcl interpreter (the smallest value always
wins). Use this option only if you want to poll the serial port more or
less often than 10 msec (the default).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-sysbuffer</strong> <em>inSize</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>-sysbuffer</strong> <em>{inSize outSize}</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows only). This option is used to change the size of Windows
system buffers for a serial channel. Especially at higher communication
rates the default input buffer size of 4096 bytes can overrun for latent
systems. The first form specifies the input buffer size, in the second
form both input and output buffers are defined.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-lasterror</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>(Windows only). This option is query only. In case of a serial
communication error, <strong>read</strong> or <strong>puts</strong>
returns a general Tcl file I/O error. <strong>fconfigure</strong>
<strong>-lasterror</strong> can be called to get a list of error
details. See below for an explanation of the various error codes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="serial-port-signals">SERIAL PORT SIGNALS</h1>
<p>RS-232 is the most commonly used standard electrical interface for
serial communications. A negative voltage (-3V..-12V) define a mark
(on=1) bit and a positive voltage (+3..+12V) define a space (off=0) bit
(RS-232C). The following signals are specified for incoming and outgoing
data, status lines and handshaking. Here we are using the terms
<em>workstation</em> for your computer and <em>modem</em> for the
external device, because some signal names (DCD, RI) come from modems.
Of course your external device may use these signal lines for other
purposes.</p>
<dl>
<dt>TXD(output)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Transmitted Data:</strong> Outgoing serial data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>RXD(input)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Received Data:</strong>Incoming serial data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>RTS(output)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Request To Send:</strong> This hardware handshake line
informs the modem that your workstation is ready to receive data. Your
workstation may automatically reset this signal to indicate that the
input buffer is full.</p>
</dd>
<dt>CTS(input)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Clear To Send:</strong> The complement to RTS. Indicates that
the modem is ready to receive data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DTR(output)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Data Terminal Ready:</strong> This signal tells the modem
that the workstation is ready to establish a link. DTR is often enabled
automatically whenever a serial port is opened.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DSR(input)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Data Set Ready:</strong> The complement to DTR. Tells the
workstation that the modem is ready to establish a link.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DCD(input)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Data Carrier Detect:</strong> This line becomes active when a
modem detects a signal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>RI(input)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Ring Indicator:</strong> Goes active when the modem detects
an incoming call.</p>
</dd>
<dt>BREAK</dt>
<dd>
<p>A BREAK condition is not a hardware signal line, but a logical zero
on the TXD or RXD lines for a long period of time, usually 250 to 500
milliseconds. Normally a receive or transmit data signal stays at the
mark (on=1) voltage until the next character is transferred. A BREAK is
sometimes used to reset the communications line or change the operating
mode of communications hardware.</p>

<h1 id="error-codes-windows-only">ERROR CODES (Windows only)</h1>
<p>A lot of different errors may occur during serial read operations or
during event polling in background. The external device may have been
switched off, the data lines may be noisy, system buffers may overrun or
your mode settings may be wrong. That is why a reliable software should
always <strong>catch</strong> serial read operations. In cases of an
error Tcl returns a general file I/O error. Then
<strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-lasterror</strong> may help to
locate the problem. The following error codes may be returned.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>RXOVER</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Windows input buffer overrun. The data comes faster than your scripts
reads it or your system is overloaded. Use <strong>fconfigure</strong>
<strong>-sysbuffer</strong> to avoid a temporary bottleneck and/or make
your script faster.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TXFULL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Windows output buffer overrun. Complement to RXOVER. This error
should practically not happen, because Tcl cares about the output buffer
status.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>OVERRUN</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>UART buffer overrun (hardware) with data lost. The data comes faster
than the system driver receives it. Check your advanced serial port
settings to enable the FIFO (16550) buffer and/or setup a lower(1)
interrupt threshold value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>RXPARITY</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A parity error has been detected by your UART. Wrong parity settings
with <strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-mode</strong> or a noisy data
line (RXD) may cause this error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FRAME</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A stop-bit error has been detected by your UART. Wrong mode settings
with <strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-mode</strong> or a noisy data
line (RXD) may cause this error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>BREAK</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A BREAK condition has been detected by your UART (see above).</p>

works for serial ports from 1 to 9. An attempt to open a serial port

<p>When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange
interactions between the real console, if one is present, and a command
pipeline that uses standard input or output. If a command pipeline is
opened for reading, some of the lines entered at the console will be
sent to the command pipeline and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator.
If a command pipeline is opened for writing, keystrokes entered into the
console are not visible until the pipe is closed. These problems only
occur because both Tcl and the child application are competing for the
console at the same time. If the command pipeline is started from a
script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command
pipeline does not use standard input or output, but is redirected from
or to a file, then the above problems do not occur.</p>
<p>Files opened in the mode or with the <strong>APPEND</strong> flag set
are implemented by seeking immediately before each write, which is not
an atomic operation and does not carry the guarantee of strict appending
that is present on POSIX platforms.</p>
