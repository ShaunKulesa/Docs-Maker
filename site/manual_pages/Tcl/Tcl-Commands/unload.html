<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command tries to unload shared libraries previously loaded with
<strong>load</strong> from the application's address space.
<em>fileName</em> is the name of the file containing the library file to
be unload; it must be the same as the filename provided to
<strong>load</strong> for loading the library. The <em>prefix</em>
argument is the prefix (as determined by or passed to
<strong>load</strong>), and is used to compute the name of the unload
procedure; if not supplied, it is computed from <em>fileName</em> in the
same manner as <strong>load</strong>. The <em>interp</em> argument is
the path name of the interpreter from which to unload the package (see
the <strong>interp</strong> manual entry for details); if
<em>interp</em> is omitted, it defaults to the interpreter in which the
<strong>unload</strong> command was invoked.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments to <strong>unload</strong> start with
<strong>-</strong> then they are treated as switches. The following
switches are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-nocomplain</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Suppresses all error messages. If this switch is given,
<strong>unload</strong> will never report an error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-keeplibrary</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This switch will prevent <strong>unload</strong> from issuing the
operating system call that will unload the library from the process.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>- -</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
treated as a <em>fileName</em> even if it starts with a
<strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>

<h2 id="unload-operation">UNLOAD OPERATION</h2>
<p>When a file containing a shared library is loaded through the
<strong>load</strong> command, Tcl associates two reference counts to
the library file. The first counter shows how many times the library has
been loaded into normal (trusted) interpreters while the second
describes how many times the library has been loaded into safe
interpreters. As a file containing a shared library can be loaded only
once by Tcl (with the first <strong>load</strong> call on the file),
these counters track how many interpreters use the library. Each
subsequent call to <strong>load</strong> after the first simply
increments the proper reference count.</p>
<p><strong>unload</strong> works in the opposite direction. As a first
step, <strong>unload</strong> will check whether the library is
unloadable: an unloadable library exports a special unload procedure.
The name of the unload procedure is determined by <em>prefix</em> and
whether or not the target interpreter is a safe one. For normal
interpreters the name of the initialization procedure will have the form
<em>pfx</em><strong>_Unload</strong>, where <em>pfx</em> is the same as
<em>prefix</em> except that the first letter is converted to upper case
and all other letters are converted to lower case. For example, if
<em>prefix</em> is <strong>foo</strong> or <strong>FOo</strong>, the
initialization procedure's name will be <strong>Foo_Unload</strong>. If
the target interpreter is a safe interpreter, then the name of the
initialization procedure will be
<em>pkg</em><strong>_SafeUnload</strong> instead of
<em>pkg</em><strong>_Unload</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>unload</strong> determines that a library is not
unloadable (or unload functionality has been disabled during
compilation), an error will be returned. If the library is unloadable,
then <strong>unload</strong> will call the unload procedure. If the
unload procedure returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong>,
<strong>unload</strong> will proceed and decrease the proper reference
count (depending on the target interpreter type). When both reference
counts have reached 0, the library will be detached from the
process.</p>
<h2 id="unload-hook-prototype">UNLOAD HOOK PROTOTYPE</h2>
<p>The unload procedure must match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_PackageUnloadProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        int flags);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument identifies the interpreter from which
the library is to be unloaded. The unload procedure must return
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> to indicate
whether or not it completed successfully; in the event of an error it
should set the interpreter's result to point to an error message. In
this case, the result of the <strong>unload</strong> command will be the
result returned by the unload procedure.</p>
<p>The <em>flags</em> argument can be either
<strong>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_INTERPRETER</strong> or
<strong>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_PROCESS</strong>. In case the library
will remain attached to the process after the unload procedure returns
(i.e. because the library is used by other interpreters),
<strong>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_INTERPRETER</strong> will be defined.
However, if the library is used only by the target interpreter and the
library will be detached from the application as soon as the unload
procedure returns, the <em>flags</em> argument will be set to
<strong>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_PROCESS</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="notes">NOTES</h2>
<p>The <strong>unload</strong> command cannot unload libraries that are
statically linked with the application. If <em>fileName</em> is an empty
string, then the <em>prefix</em> argument must be specified.</p>
<p>If <em>prefix</em> is omitted or specified as an empty string, Tcl
tries to guess the prefix. This may be done differently on different
platforms. The default guess, which is used on most UNIX platforms, is
to take the last element of <em>fileName</em>, strip off the first three
characters if they are <strong>lib</strong>, and use any following
alphabetic and underline characters, converted to titlecase as the
prefix. For example, the command <strong>unload libxyz4.2.so</strong>
uses the prefix <strong>Xyz</strong> and the command <strong>unload
bin/last.so {}</strong> uses the prefix <strong>Last</strong>.</p>

<p>Not all unix operating systems support library unloading. Under such
an operating system <strong>unload</strong> returns an error (unless
<strong>-nocomplain</strong> has been specified).</p>

<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>If the same file is <strong>load</strong>ed by different
<em>fileName</em>s, it will be loaded into the process's address space
multiple times. The behavior of this varies from system to system (some
systems may detect the redundant loads, others may not). In case a
library has been silently detached by the operating system (and as a
result Tcl thinks the library is still loaded), it may be dangerous to
use <strong>unload</strong> on such a library (as the library will be
completely detached from the application while some interpreters will
continue to use it).</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>If an unloadable module in the file <strong>foobar.dll</strong> had
been loaded using the <strong>load</strong> command like this (on
Windows):</p>
<pre><code>load c:/some/dir/foobar.dll</code></pre>
<p>then it would be unloaded like this:</p>
<pre><code>unload c:/some/dir/foobar.dll</code></pre>
<p>This allows a C code module to be installed temporarily into a
long-running Tcl program and then removed again (either because it is no
longer needed or because it is being updated with a new version) without
having to shut down the overall Tcl process.</p>
