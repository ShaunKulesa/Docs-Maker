<p>refchan - command handler API of reflected channels</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>cmdPrefix</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The Tcl-level handler for a reflected channel has to be a command
with subcommands (termed an <em>ensemble</em>, as it is a command such
as that created by <strong>namespace ensemble</strong>
<strong>create</strong>, though the implementation of handlers for
reflected channel <em>is not</em> tied to <strong>namespace</strong>
ensembles in any way; see <strong>EXAMPLE</strong> below for how to
build an <strong>oo::class</strong> that supports the API). Note that
<em>cmdPrefix</em> is whatever was specified in the call to <strong>chan
create</strong>, and may consist of multiple arguments; this will be
expanded to multiple words in place of the prefix.</p>
<p>Of all the possible subcommands, the handler <em>must</em> support
<strong>initialize</strong>, <strong>finalize</strong>, and
<strong>watch</strong>. Support for the other subcommands is
optional.</p>
<h2 id="mandatory-subcommands">MANDATORY SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>initialize</strong> <em>channelId
mode</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>An invocation of this subcommand will be the first call the
<em>cmdPrefix</em> will receive for the specified new
<em>channelId</em>. It is the responsibility of this subcommand to set
up any internal data structures required to keep track of the channel
and its state.</p>
<p>The return value of the method has to be a list containing the names
of all subcommands supported by the <em>cmdPrefix</em>. This also tells
the Tcl core which version of the API for reflected channels is used by
this command handler.</p>
<p>Any error thrown by the method will abort the creation of the channel
and no channel will be created. The thrown error will appear as error
thrown by <strong>chan create</strong>. Any exception other than an
<strong>error</strong> (e.g., <strong>break</strong>, etc.) is treated
as (and converted to) an error.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the creation of the channel was aborted due
to failures here, then the <strong>finalize</strong> subcommand will not
be called.</p>
<p>The <em>mode</em> argument tells the handler whether the channel was
opened for reading, writing, or both. It is a list containing any of the
strings <strong>read</strong> or <strong>write</strong>. The list will
always contain at least one element.</p>
<p>The subcommand must throw an error if the chosen mode is not
supported by the <em>cmdPrefix</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>finalize</strong> <em>channelId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>An invocation of this subcommand will be the last call the
<em>cmdPrefix</em> will receive for the specified <em>channelId</em>. It
will be generated just before the destruction of the data structures of
the channel held by the Tcl core. The command handler <em>must not</em>
access the <em>channelId</em> anymore in no way. Upon this subcommand
being called, any internal resources allocated to this channel must be
cleaned up.</p>
<p>The return value of this subcommand is ignored.</p>
<p>If the subcommand throws an error the command which caused its
invocation (usually <strong>chan close</strong>) will appear to have
thrown this error. Any exception beyond <strong>error</strong> (e.g.,
<strong>break</strong>, etc.) is treated as (and converted to) an
error.</p>
<p>This subcommand is not invoked if the creation of the channel was
aborted during <strong>initialize</strong> (See above).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>watch</strong> <em>channelId
eventspec</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This subcommand notifies the <em>cmdPrefix</em> that the specified
<em>channelId</em> is interested in the events listed in the
<em>eventspec</em>. This argument is a list containing any of
<strong>read</strong> and <strong>write</strong>. The list may be empty,
which signals that the channel does not wish to be notified of any
events. In that situation, the handler should disable event generation
completely.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Any return value of the subcommand is
ignored. This includes all errors thrown by the subcommand,
<strong>break</strong>, <strong>continue</strong>, and custom return
codes.</p>
<p>This subcommand interacts with <strong>chan postevent</strong>.
Trying to post an event which was not listed in the last call to
<strong>watch</strong> will cause <strong>chan postevent</strong> to
throw an error.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="optional-subcommands">OPTIONAL SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>read</strong> <em>channelId
count</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <em>optional</em> subcommand is called when the user requests
data from the channel <em>channelId</em>. <em>count</em> specifies how
many <em>bytes</em> have been requested. If the subcommand is not
supported then it is not possible to read from the channel handled by
the command.</p>
<p>The return value of this subcommand is taken as the requested data
<em>bytes</em>. If the returned data contains more bytes than requested,
an error will be signaled and later thrown by the command which
performed the read (usually <strong>gets</strong> or
<strong>read</strong>). However, returning fewer bytes than requested is
acceptable.</p>
<p>Note that returning nothing (0 bytes) is a signal to the higher
layers that <strong>EOF</strong> has been reached on the channel. To
signal that the channel is out of data right now, but has not yet
reached <strong>EOF</strong>, it is necessary to throw the error
"EAGAIN", i.e. to either</p>
<pre><code>return -code error EAGAIN</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>error EAGAIN</code></pre>
<p>For extensibility any error whose value is a negative integer number
will cause the higher layers to set the C-level variable
"<strong>errno</strong>" to the absolute value of this number, signaling
a system error. However, note that the exact mapping between these error
numbers and their meanings is operating system dependent.</p>
<p>For example, while on Linux both</p>
<pre><code>return -code error -11</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>error -11</code></pre>
<p>are equivalent to the examples above, using the more readable string
"EAGAIN", this is not true for BSD, where the equivalent number is
-35.</p>
<p>The symbolic string however is the same across systems, and
internally translated to the correct number. No other error value has
such a mapping to a symbolic string.</p>
<p>If the subcommand throws any other error, the command which caused
its invocation (usually <strong>gets</strong>, or <strong>read</strong>)
will appear to have thrown this error. Any exception beyond
<strong>error</strong>, (e.g., <strong>break</strong>, etc.) is treated
as and converted to an error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>write</strong> <em>channelId
data</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <em>optional</em> subcommand is called when the user writes data
to the channel <em>channelId</em>. The <em>data</em> argument contains
<em>bytes</em>, not characters. Any type of transformation (EOL,
encoding) configured for the channel has already been applied at this
point. If this subcommand is not supported then it is not possible to
write to the channel handled by the command.</p>
<p>The return value of the subcommand is taken as the number of bytes
written by the channel. Anything non-numeric will cause an error to be
signaled and later thrown by the command which performed the write. A
negative value implies that the write failed. Returning a value greater
than the number of bytes given to the handler, or zero, is forbidden and
will cause the Tcl core to throw an error.</p>
<p>To signal that the channel is not able to accept data for writing
right now, it is necessary to throw the error "EAGAIN", i.e. to
either</p>
<pre><code>return -code error EAGAIN</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>error EAGAIN</code></pre>
<p>For extensibility any error whose value is a negative integer number
will cause the higher layers to set the C-level variable
"<strong>errno</strong>" to the absolute value of this number, signaling
a system error. However, note that the exact mapping between these error
numbers and their meanings is operating system dependent.</p>
<p>For example, while on Linux both</p>
<pre><code>return -code error -11</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>error -11</code></pre>
<p>are equivalent to the examples above, using the more readable string
"EAGAIN", this is not true for BSD, where the equivalent number is
-35.</p>
<p>The symbolic string however is the same across systems, and
internally translated to the correct number. No other error value has
such a mapping to a symbolic string.</p>
<p>If the subcommand throws any other error the command which caused its
invocation (usually <strong>puts</strong>) will appear to have thrown
this error. Any exception beyond <strong>error</strong> (e.g.,
<strong>break</strong>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an
error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>seek</strong> <em>channelId offset
base</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <em>optional</em> subcommand is responsible for the handling of
<strong>chan seek</strong> and <strong>chan tell</strong> requests on
the channel <em>channelId</em>. If it is not supported then seeking will
not be possible for the channel.</p>
<p>The <em>base</em> argument is the same as the equivalent argument of
the builtin <strong>chan seek</strong>, namely:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>start</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Seeking is relative to the beginning of the channel.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>current</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Seeking is relative to the current seek position.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>end</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Seeking is relative to the end of the channel.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <em>offset</em> is an integer number specifying the amount of
<strong>bytes</strong> to seek forward or backward. A positive number
should seek forward, and a negative number should seek backward. A
channel may provide only limited seeking. For example sockets can seek
forward, but not backward.</p>
<p>The return value of the subcommand is taken as the (new) location of
the channel, counted from the start. This has to be an integer number
greater than or equal to zero. If the subcommand throws an error the
command which caused its invocation (usually <strong>chan seek</strong>,
or <strong>chan tell</strong>) will appear to have thrown this error.
Any exception beyond <strong>error</strong> (e.g.,
<strong>break</strong>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an
error.</p>
<p>The offset/base combination of 0/<strong>current</strong> signals a
<strong>chan tell</strong> request, i.e., seek nothing relative to the
current location, making the new location identical to the current one,
which is then returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>configure</strong> <em>channelId option
value</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <em>optional</em> subcommand is for setting the type-specific
options of channel <em>channelId</em>. The <em>option</em> argument
indicates the option to be written, and the <em>value</em> argument
indicates the value to set the option to.</p>
<p>This subcommand will never try to update more than one option at a
time; that is behavior implemented in the Tcl channel core.</p>
<p>The return value of the subcommand is ignored.</p>
<p>If the subcommand throws an error the command which performed the
(re)configuration or query (usually <strong>fconfigure</strong> or
<strong>chan configure</strong>) will appear to have thrown this error.
Any exception beyond <strong>error</strong> (e.g.,
<strong>break</strong>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an
error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>channelId
option</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <em>optional</em> subcommand is used when reading a single
type-specific option of channel <em>channelId</em>. If this subcommand
is supported then the subcommand <strong>cgetall</strong> must be
supported as well.</p>
<p>The subcommand should return the value of the specified
<em>option</em>.</p>
<p>If the subcommand throws an error, the command which performed the
(re)configuration or query (usually <strong>fconfigure</strong> or
<strong>chan configure</strong>) will appear to have thrown this error.
Any exception beyond <em>error</em> (e.g., <strong>break</strong>, etc.)
is treated as and converted to an error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>cgetall</strong> <em>channelId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <em>optional</em> subcommand is used for reading all
type-specific options of channel <em>channelId</em>. If this subcommand
is supported then the subcommand <strong>cget</strong> has to be
supported as well.</p>
<p>The subcommand should return a list of all options and their values.
This list must have an even number of elements.</p>
<p>If the subcommand throws an error the command which performed the
(re)configuration or query (usually <strong>fconfigure</strong> or
<strong>chan configure</strong>) will appear to have thrown this error.
Any exception beyond <strong>error</strong> (e.g.,
<strong>break</strong>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an
error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cmdPrefix</em> <strong>blocking</strong> <em>channelId
mode</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <em>optional</em> subcommand handles changes to the blocking
mode of the channel <em>channelId</em>. The <em>mode</em> is a boolean
flag. A true value means that the channel has to be set to blocking, and
a false value means that the channel should be non-blocking.</p>
<p>The return value of the subcommand is ignored.</p>
<p>If the subcommand throws an error the command which caused its
invocation (usually <strong>fconfigure</strong> or <strong>chan
configure</strong>) will appear to have thrown this error. Any exception
beyond <strong>error</strong> (e.g., <strong>break</strong>, etc.) is
treated as and converted to an error.</p>

<h1 id="notes">NOTES</h1>
<p>Some of the functions supported in channels defined in Tcl's C
interface are not available to channels reflected to the Tcl level.</p>
<p>The function <strong>Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc</strong> is not
supported; i.e., reflected channels do not have OS specific handles.</p>
<p>The function <strong>Tcl_DriverHandlerProc</strong> is not supported.
This driver function is relevant only for stacked channels, i.e.,
transformations. Reflected channels are always base channels, not
transformations.</p>
<p>The function <strong>Tcl_DriverFlushProc</strong> is not supported.
This is because the current generic I/O layer of Tcl does not use this
function anywhere at all. Therefore support at the Tcl level makes no
sense either. This may be altered in the future (through extending the
API defined here and changing its version number) should the function be
used at some time in the future.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This demonstrates how to make a channel that reads from a string.</p>
<pre><code>oo::class create stringchan {
    variable data pos
    constructor {string {encoding {}}} {
        if {$encoding eq &quot;&quot;} {set encoding [encoding system]}
        set data [encoding convertto $encoding $string]
        set pos 0
    }

    method initialize {ch mode} {
        return &quot;initialize finalize watch read seek&quot;
    }
    method finalize {ch} {
        my destroy
    }
    method watch {ch events} {
        # Must be present but we ignore it because we do not
        # post any events
    }

    # Must be present on a readable channel
    method read {ch count} {
        set d [string range $data $pos [expr {$pos+$count-1}]]
        incr pos [string length $d]
        return $d
    }

    # This method is optional, but useful for the example below
    method seek {ch offset base} {
        switch $base {
            start {
                set pos $offset
            }
            current {
                incr pos $offset
            }
            end {
                set pos [string length $data]
                incr pos $offset
