<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>proc - Create a Tcl procedure</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>proc</strong> <em>name args body</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>proc</strong> command creates a new Tcl procedure named
<em>name</em>, replacing any existing command or procedure there may
have been by that name. Whenever the new command is invoked, the
contents of <em>body</em> will be executed by the Tcl interpreter.
Normally, <em>name</em> is unqualified (does not include the names of
any containing namespaces), and the new procedure is created in the
current namespace. If <em>name</em> includes any namespace qualifiers,
the procedure is created in the specified namespace. <em>Args</em>
specifies the formal arguments to the procedure. It consists of a list,
possibly empty, each of whose elements specifies one argument. Each
argument specifier is also a list with either one or two fields. If
there is only a single field in the specifier then it is the name of the
argument; if there are two fields, then the first is the argument name
and the second is its default value. Arguments with default values that
are followed by non-defaulted arguments become required arguments;
enough actual arguments must be supplied to allow all arguments up to
and including the last required formal argument.</p>
<p>When <em>name</em> is invoked a local variable will be created for
each of the formal arguments to the procedure; its value will be the
value of corresponding argument in the invoking command or the
argument's default value. Actual arguments are assigned to formal
arguments strictly in order. Arguments with default values need not be
specified in a procedure invocation. However, there must be enough
actual arguments for all the formal arguments that do not have defaults,
and there must not be any extra actual arguments. Arguments with default
values that are followed by non-defaulted arguments become de-facto
required arguments, though this may change in a future version of Tcl;
portable code should ensure that all optional arguments come after all
required arguments.</p>
<p>There is one special case to permit procedures with variable numbers
of arguments. If the last formal argument has the name then a call to
the procedure may contain more actual arguments than the procedure has
formal arguments. In this case, all of the actual arguments starting at
the one that would be assigned to <strong>args</strong> are combined
into a list (as if the <strong>list</strong> command had been used);
this combined value is assigned to the local variable
<strong>args</strong>.</p>
<p>When <em>body</em> is being executed, variable names normally refer
to local variables, which are created automatically when referenced and
deleted when the procedure returns. One local variable is automatically
created for each of the procedure's arguments. Other variables can only
be accessed by invoking one of the <strong>global</strong>,
<strong>variable</strong>, <strong>upvar</strong> or <strong>namespace
upvar</strong> commands. The current namespace when <em>body</em> is
executed will be the namespace that the procedure's name exists in,
which will be the namespace that it was created in unless it has been
changed with <strong>rename</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>proc</strong> command returns an empty string. When a
procedure is invoked, the procedure's return value is the value
specified in a <strong>return</strong> command. If the procedure does
not execute an explicit <strong>return</strong>, then its return value
is the value of the last command executed in the procedure's body. If an
error occurs while executing the procedure body, then the
procedure-as-a-whole will return that same error.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This is a procedure that takes two arguments and prints both their
sum and their product. It also returns the string to the caller as an
explicit result.</p>
<pre><code>proc printSumProduct {x y} {
    set sum [expr {$x + $y}]
    set prod [expr {$x * $y}]
    puts &quot;sum is $sum, product is $prod&quot;
    return &quot;OK&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a procedure that accepts arbitrarily many arguments and
prints them out, one by one.</p>
<pre><code>proc printArguments args {
    foreach arg $args {
        puts $arg
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This procedure is a bit like the <strong>incr</strong> command,
except it multiplies the contents of the named variable by the value,
which defaults to <strong>2</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>proc mult {varName {multiplier 2}} {
    upvar 1 $varName var
    set var [expr {$var * $multiplier}]
}</code></pre>
