<p>oo::object - root class of the class hierarchy</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>package require TclOO

oo::object method ?arg ...?</code></pre>
<h1 id="class-hierarchy">CLASS HIERARCHY</h1>
<pre><code>oo::object</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>oo::object</strong> class is the root class of the object
hierarchy; every object is an instance of this class. Since classes are
themselves objects, they are instances of this class too. Objects are
always referred to by their name, and may be <strong>rename</strong>d
while maintaining their identity.</p>
<p>Instances of objects may be made with either the
<strong>create</strong> or <strong>new</strong> methods of the
<strong>oo::object</strong> object itself, or by invoking those methods
on any of the subclass objects; see <strong>oo::class</strong> for more
details. The configuration of individual objects (i.e.,
instance-specific methods, mixed-in classes, etc.) may be controlled
with the <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> command.</p>
<p>Each object has a unique namespace associated with it, the instance
namespace. This namespace holds all the instance variables of the
object, and will be the current namespace whenever a method of the
object is invoked (including a method of the class of the object). When
the object is destroyed, its instance namespace is deleted. The instance
namespace contains the object's <strong>my</strong> command, which may
be used to invoke non-exported methods of the object or to create a
reference to the object for the purpose of invocation which persists
across renamings of the object.</p>
<h2 id="constructor">CONSTRUCTOR</h2>
<p>The <strong>oo::object</strong> class does not define an explicit
constructor.</p>
<h2 id="destructor">DESTRUCTOR</h2>
<p>The <strong>oo::object</strong> class does not define an explicit
destructor.</p>
<h2 id="exported-methods">EXPORTED METHODS</h2>
<p>The <strong>oo::object</strong> class supports the following exported
methods:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>obj</em> <strong>destroy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This method destroys the object, <em>obj</em>, that it is invoked
upon, invoking any destructors on the object's class in the process. It
is equivalent to using <strong>rename</strong> to delete the object
command. The result of this method is always the empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="non-exported-methods">NON-EXPORTED METHODS</h2>
<p>The <strong>oo::object</strong> class supports the following
non-exported methods:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>obj</em> <strong>eval</strong> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method concatenates the arguments, <em>arg</em>, as if with
<strong>concat</strong>, and then evaluates the resulting script in the
namespace that is uniquely associated with <em>obj</em>, returning the
result of the evaluation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>obj</em> <strong>unknown ?</strong><em>methodName</em>? ?<em>arg
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is called when an attempt to invoke the method
<em>methodName</em> on object <em>obj</em> fails. The arguments that the
user supplied to the method are given as <em>arg</em> arguments.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <em>methodName</em> is absent, the object was invoked with no
method name at all (or any other arguments).</p>
<p>The default implementation (i.e., the one defined by the
<strong>oo::object</strong> class) generates a suitable error, detailing
what methods the object supports given whether the object was invoked by
its public name or through the <strong>my</strong> command.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>obj</em> <strong>variable</strong> ?<em>varName ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method arranges for each variable called <em>varName</em> to be
linked from the object <em>obj</em>'s unique namespace into the caller's
context. Thus, if it is invoked from inside a procedure then the
namespace variable in the object is linked to the local variable in the
procedure. Each <em>varName</em> argument must not have any namespace
separators in it. The result is the empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>obj</em> <strong>varname</strong> <em>varName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns the globally qualified name of the variable
<em>varName</em> in the unique namespace for the object
<em>obj</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>obj</em> <strong>&lt;cloned&gt;</strong>
<em>sourceObjectName</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This method is used by the <strong>oo::object</strong> command to
copy the state of one object to another. It is responsible for copying
the procedures and variables of the namespace of the source object
(<em>sourceObjectName</em>) to the current object. It does not copy any
other types of commands or any traces on the variables; that can be
added if desired by overriding this method in a subclass.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates basic use of an object.</p>
<pre><code>set obj [oo::object new]
$obj foo             → error &quot;unknown method foo&quot;
oo::objdefine $obj method foo {} {
    my variable count
    puts &quot;bar[incr count]&quot;
}
$obj foo             → prints &quot;bar1&quot;
$obj foo             → prints &quot;bar2&quot;
$obj variable count  → error &quot;unknown method variable&quot;
$obj destroy
$obj foo             → error &quot;unknown command obj&quot;</code></pre>
