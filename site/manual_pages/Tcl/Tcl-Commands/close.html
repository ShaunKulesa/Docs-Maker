<p>close - Close an open channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>close</strong> <em>channelId</em> ?r(ead)|w(rite)?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Closes or half-closes the channel given by <em>channelId</em>.</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> must be an identifier for an open channel such as
a Tcl standard channel (<strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong>,
or <strong>stderr</strong>), the return value from an invocation of
<strong>open</strong> or <strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a
channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.</p>
<p>The single-argument form is a simple all buffered output is flushed
to the channel's output device, any buffered input is discarded, the
underlying file or device is closed, and <em>channelId</em> becomes
unavailable for use.</p>
<p>If the channel is blocking, the command does not return until all
output is flushed. If the channel is nonblocking and there is unflushed
output, the channel remains open and the command returns immediately;
output will be flushed in the background and the channel will be closed
when all the flushing is complete.</p>
<p>If <em>channelId</em> is a blocking channel for a command pipeline
then <strong>close</strong> waits for the child processes to
complete.</p>
<p>If the channel is shared between interpreters, then
<strong>close</strong> makes <em>channelId</em> unavailable in the
invoking interpreter but has no other effect until all of the sharing
interpreters have closed the channel. When the last interpreter in which
the channel is registered invokes <strong>close</strong>, the cleanup
actions described above occur. See the <strong>interp</strong> command
for a description of channel sharing.</p>
<p>Channels are automatically closed when an interpreter is destroyed
and when the process exits.</p>
<p>From 8.6 on (TIP#398), nonblocking channels are no longer switched to
blocking mode when exiting; this guarantees a timely exit even when the
peer or a communication channel is stalled. To ensure proper flushing of
stalled nonblocking channels on exit, one must now either (a) actively
switch them back to blocking or (b) use the environment variable
TCL_FLUSH_NONBLOCKING_ON_EXIT, which when set and not equal to "0"
restores the previous behavior.</p>
<p>The command returns an empty string, and may generate an error if an
error occurs while flushing output. If a command in a command pipeline
created with <strong>open</strong> returns an error,
<strong>close</strong> generates an error (similar to the
<strong>exec</strong> command.)</p>
<p>The two-argument form is a given a bidirectional channel like a
socket or command pipeline and a (possibly abbreviated) direction, it
closes only the sub-stream going in that direction. This means a
shutdown() on a socket, and a close() of one end of a pipe for a command
pipeline. Then, the Tcl-level channel data structure is either kept or
freed depending on whether the other direction is still open.</p>
<p>A single-argument close on an already half-closed bidirectional
channel is defined to just A half-close on an already closed half, or on
a wrong-sided unidirectional channel, raises an error.</p>
<p>In the case of a command pipeline, the child-reaping duty falls upon
the shoulders of the last close or half-close, which is thus allowed to
report an abnormal exit error.</p>
<p>Currently only sockets and command pipelines support half-close. A
future extension will allow reflected and stacked channels to do so.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This illustrates how you can use Tcl to ensure that files get closed
even when errors happen by combining <strong>catch</strong>,
<strong>close</strong> and <strong>return</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>proc withOpenFile {filename channelVar script} {
    upvar 1 $channelVar chan
    set chan [open $filename]
    catch {
        uplevel 1 $script
    } result options
    close $chan
    return -options $options $result
}</code></pre>
