<p>self - method call internal introspection</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>package require TclOO

self ?subcommand?</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>self</strong> command, which should only be used from
within the context of a call to a method (i.e. inside a method,
constructor or destructor body) is used to allow the method to discover
information about how it was called. It takes an argument,
<em>subcommand</em>, that tells it what sort of information is actually
desired; if omitted the result will be the same as if
<strong>self</strong> object was invoked. The supported subcommands
are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>self call</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This returns a two-element list describing the method implementations
used to implement the current call chain. The first element is the same
as would be reported by <strong>info object</strong>
<strong>call</strong> for the current method (except that this also
reports useful values from within constructors and destructors, whose
names are reported as <strong>&lt;constructor&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;destructor&gt;</strong> respectively), and the second
element is an index into the first element's list that indicates which
actual implementation is currently executing (the first implementation
to execute is always at index 0).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self caller</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When the method was invoked from inside another object method, this
subcommand returns a three element list describing the containing object
and method. The first element describes the declaring object or class of
the method, the second element is the name of the object on which the
containing method was invoked, and the third element is the name of the
method (with the strings <strong>&lt;constructor&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;destructor&gt;</strong> indicating constructors and
destructors respectively).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self class</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This returns the name of the class that the current method was
defined within. Note that this will change as the chain of method
implementations is traversed with <strong>next</strong>, and that if the
method was defined on an object then this will fail.</p>
<p>If you want the class of the current object, you need to use this
other construct:</p>
<pre><code>info object class [self object]</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self filter</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When invoked inside a filter, this subcommand returns a three element
list describing the filter. The first element gives the name of the
object or class that declared the filter (note that this may be
different from the object or class that provided the implementation of
the filter), the second element is either <strong>object</strong> or
<strong>class</strong> depending on whether the declaring entity was an
object or class, and the third element is the name of the filter.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self method</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This returns the name of the current method (with the strings
<strong>&lt;constructor&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;destructor&gt;</strong> indicating constructors and
destructors respectively).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self namespace</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This returns the name of the unique namespace of the object that the
method was invoked upon.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self next</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When invoked from a method that is not at the end of a call chain
(i.e. where the <strong>next</strong> command will invoke an actual
method implementation), this subcommand returns a two element list
describing the next element in the method call chain; the first element
is the name of the class or object that declares the next part of the
call chain, and the second element is the name of the method (with the
strings <strong>&lt;constructor&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;destructor&gt;</strong> indicating constructors and
destructors respectively). If invoked from a method that is at the end
of a call chain, this subcommand returns the empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self object</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This returns the name of the object that the method was invoked
upon.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self target</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When invoked inside a filter implementation, this subcommand returns
a two element list describing the method being filtered. The first
element will be the name of the declarer of the method, and the second
element will be the actual name of the method.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example shows basic use of <strong>self</strong> to provide
information about the current object:</p>
<pre><code>oo::class create c {
    method foo {} {
        puts &quot;this is the [self] object&quot;
    }
}
c create a
c create b
a foo                → prints &quot;this is the ::a object&quot;
b foo                → prints &quot;this is the ::b object&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates what a method call chain looks like, and how
traversing along it changes the index into it:</p>
<pre><code>oo::class create c {
    method x {} {
        puts &quot;Cls: [self call]&quot;
    }
}
c create a
oo::objdefine a {
    method x {} {
        puts &quot;Obj: [self call]&quot;
        next
        puts &quot;Obj: [self call]&quot;
    }
}
a x     → Obj: {{method x object method} {method x ::c method}} 0
        → Cls: {{method x object method} {method x ::c method}} 1
        → Obj: {{method x object method} {method x ::c method}} 0</code></pre>
