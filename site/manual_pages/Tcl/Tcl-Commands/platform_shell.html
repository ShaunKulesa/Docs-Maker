<p>platform::shell - System identification support code and

<pre><code>package require platform::shell ?1.1.4?

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>platform::shell</strong> package provides several utility
commands useful for the identification of the architecture of a specific
Tcl shell.</p>
<p>This package allows the identification of the architecture of a
specific Tcl shell different from the shell running the package. The
only requirement is that the other shell (identified by its path), is
actually executable on the current machine.</p>
<p>While for most platform this means that the architecture of the
interrogated shell is identical to the architecture of the running shell
this is not generally true. A counter example are all platforms which
have 32 and 64 bit variants and where a 64bit system is able to run
32bit code. For these running and interrogated shell may have different
32/64 bit settings and thus different identifiers.</p>
<p>For applications like a code repository it is important to identify
the architecture of the shell which will actually run the installed
packages, versus the architecture of the shell running the repository
software.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>platform::shell::identify</strong> <em>shell</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command does the same identification as

contrast to the running shell.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>platform::shell::generic</strong> <em>shell</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command does the same identification as
<strong>platform::generic</strong>, for the specified Tcl shell, in
contrast to the running shell.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>platform::shell::platform</strong> <em>shell</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command returns the contents of
<strong>tcl_platform(platform)</strong> for the specified Tcl shell.</p>
