<pre><code>zlib subcommand arg ...</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>zlib</strong> command provides access to the compression
and check-summing facilities of the Zlib library by Jean-loup Gailly and
Mark Adler. It has the following subcommands.</p>
<h2 id="compression-subcommands">COMPRESSION SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib compress</strong> <em>string</em> ?<em>level</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the zlib-format compressed binary data of the binary string
in <em>string</em>. If present, <em>level</em> gives the compression
level to use (from 0, which is uncompressed, to 9, maximally
compressed).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib decompress</strong> <em>string</em>
?<em>bufferSize</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the uncompressed version of the raw compressed binary data in
<em>string</em>. If present, <em>bufferSize</em> is a hint as to what
size of buffer is to be used to receive the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib deflate</strong> <em>string</em> ?<em>level</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the raw compressed binary data of the binary string in
<em>string</em>. If present, <em>level</em> gives the compression level
to use (from 0, which is uncompressed, to 9, maximally compressed).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib gunzip</strong> <em>string</em>
?<strong>-headerVar</strong> <em>varName</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return the uncompressed contents of binary string <em>string</em>,
which must have been in gzip format. If <strong>-headerVar</strong> is
given, store a dictionary describing the contents of the gzip header in
the variable called <em>varName</em>. The keys of the dictionary that
may be present are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>comment</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The comment field from the header, if present.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>crc</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A boolean value describing whether a CRC of the header is
computed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>filename</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The filename field from the header, if present.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>os</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The operating system type code field from the header (if not the QW
unknown value). See RFC 1952 for the meaning of these codes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>size</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The size of the uncompressed data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>time</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The time field from the header if non-zero, expected to be time that
the file named by the <strong>filename</strong> field was modified.
Suitable for use with <strong>clock format</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>type</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of the uncompressed data (<strong>binary</strong> or
<strong>text</strong>) if known.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib gzip</strong> <em>string</em> ?<strong>-level</strong>
<em>level</em>? ?<strong>-header</strong> <em>dict</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return the compressed contents of binary string <em>string</em> in
gzip format. If <strong>-level</strong> is given, <em>level</em> gives
the compression level to use (from 0, which is uncompressed, to 9,
maximally compressed). If <strong>-header</strong> is given,
<em>dict</em> is a dictionary containing values used for the gzip
header. The following keys may be defined:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>comment</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add the given comment to the header of the gzip-format data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>crc</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A boolean saying whether to compute a CRC of the header. Note that if
the data is to be interchanged with the <strong>gzip</strong> program, a
header CRC should <em>not</em> be computed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>filename</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the file that the data to be compressed came from.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>os</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The operating system type code, which should be one of the values
described in RFC 1952.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>time</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The time that the file named in the <strong>filename</strong> key was
last modified. This will be in the same as is returned by <strong>clock
seconds</strong> or <strong>file mtime</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>type</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of the data being compressed, being <strong>binary</strong>
or <strong>text</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib inflate</strong> <em>string</em>
?<em>bufferSize</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the uncompressed version of the raw compressed binary data in
<em>string</em>. If present, <em>bufferSize</em> is a hint as to what
size of buffer is to be used to receive the data.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="channel-subcommand">CHANNEL SUBCOMMAND</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib push</strong> <em>mode channel</em> ?<em>options
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pushes a compressing or decompressing transformation onto the channel
<em>channel</em>. The transformation can be removed again with
<strong>chan pop</strong>. The <em>mode</em> argument determines what
type of transformation is pushed; the following are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>compress</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The transformation will be a compressing transformation that produces
zlib-format data on <em>channel</em>, which must be writable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>decompress</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The transformation will be a decompressing transformation that reads
zlib-format data from <em>channel</em>, which must be readable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>deflate</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The transformation will be a compressing transformation that produces
raw compressed data on <em>channel</em>, which must be writable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>gunzip</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The transformation will be a decompressing transformation that reads
gzip-format data from <em>channel</em>, which must be readable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>gzip</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The transformation will be a compressing transformation that produces
gzip-format data on <em>channel</em>, which must be writable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>inflate</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The transformation will be a decompressing transformation that reads
raw compressed data from <em>channel</em>, which must be readable.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following options may be set when creating a transformation via
the to the <strong>zlib push</strong> command:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-dictionary</strong> <em>binData</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sets the compression dictionary to use when working with compressing
or decompressing the data to be <em>binData</em>. Not valid for
transformations that work with gzip-format data. The dictionary should
consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely to be encountered
later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly used strings
preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Tcl provides no
mechanism for choosing a good such dictionary for a particular data
sequence.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-header</strong> <em>dictionary</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Passes a description of the gzip header to create, in the same format
that <strong>zlib gzip</strong> understands.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-level</strong> <em>compressionLevel</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>How hard to compress the data. Must be an integer from 0
(uncompressed) to 9 (maximally compressed).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-limit</strong> <em>readaheadLimit</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of bytes ahead to read when decompressing.</p>
<p>This option has become <strong>irrelevant</strong>. It was originally
introduced to prevent Tcl from reading beyond the end of a compressed
stream in multi-stream channels to ensure that the data after was left
alone for further reading, at the cost of speed.</p>
<p>Tcl now automatically returns any bytes it has read beyond the end of
a compressed stream back to the channel, making them appear as unread to
further readers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both compressing and decompressing channel transformations add extra
configuration options that may be accessed through <strong>chan
configure</strong>. The options are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-checksum</strong> <em>checksum</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This read-only option gets the current checksum for the uncompressed
data that the compression engine has seen so far. It is valid for both
compressing and decompressing transforms, but not for the raw inflate
and deflate formats. The compression algorithm depends on what format is
being produced or consumed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-dictionary</strong> <em>binData</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This read-write options gets or sets the initial compression
dictionary to use when working with compressing or decompressing the
data to be <em>binData</em>. It is not valid for transformations that
work with gzip-format data, and should not normally be set on
compressing transformations other than at the point where the
transformation is stacked. Note that this cannot be used to get the
current active compression dictionary mid-stream, as that information is
not exposed by the underlying library.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-flush</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This write-only operation flushes the current state of the compressor
to the underlying channel. It is only valid for compressing
transformations. The <em>type</em> must be either <strong>sync</strong>
or <strong>full</strong> for a normal flush or an expensive flush
respectively. Flushing degrades the compression ratio, but makes it
easier for a decompressor to recover more of the file in the case of
data corruption.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-header</strong> <em>dictionary</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This read-only option, only valid for decompressing transforms that
are processing gzip-format data, returns the dictionary describing the
header read off the data stream.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-limit</strong> <em>readaheadLimit</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This read-write option is used by decompressing channels to control
the maximum number of bytes ahead to read from the underlying data
source. See above for more information.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="streaming-subcommand">STREAMING SUBCOMMAND</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib stream</strong> <em>mode</em> ?<em>options</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates a streaming compression or decompression command based on the
<em>mode</em>, and return the name of the command. For a description of
how that command works, see <strong>STREAMING INSTANCE COMMAND</strong>
below. The following modes and <em>options</em> are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib stream compress</strong> ?<strong>-dictionary</strong>
<em>bindata</em>? ?<strong>-level</strong> <em>level</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stream will be a compressing stream that produces zlib-format
output, using compression level <em>level</em> (if specified) which will
be an integer from 0 to 9,</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and the compression dictionary <em>bindata</em> (if specified).</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib stream decompress</strong>
?<strong>-dictionary</strong> <em>bindata</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stream will be a decompressing stream that takes zlib-format
input and produces uncompressed output.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <em>bindata</em> is supplied, it is a compression dictionary to
use if required.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib stream deflate</strong> ?<strong>-dictionary</strong>
<em>bindata</em>? ?<strong>-level</strong> <em>level</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stream will be a compressing stream that produces raw output,
using compression level <em>level</em> (if specified) which will be an
integer from 0 to 9,</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and the compression dictionary <em>bindata</em> (if specified). Note
that the raw compressed data includes no metadata about what compression
dictionary was used, if any; that is a feature of the zlib-format
data.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib stream gunzip</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The stream will be a decompressing stream that takes gzip-format
input and produces uncompressed output.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib stream gzip</strong> ?<strong>-header</strong>
<em>header</em>? ?<strong>-level</strong> <em>level</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stream will be a compressing stream that produces gzip-format
output, using compression level <em>level</em> (if specified) which will
be an integer from 0 to 9, and the header descriptor dictionary
<em>header</em> (if specified; for keys see <strong>zlib
gzip</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib stream inflate</strong> ?<strong>-dictionary</strong>
<em>bindata</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stream will be a decompressing stream that takes raw compressed
input and produces uncompressed output.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <em>bindata</em> is supplied, it is a compression dictionary to
use. Note that there are no checks in place to determine whether the
compression dictionary is correct.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="checksumming-subcommands">CHECKSUMMING SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>zlib adler32</strong> <em>string</em>
?<em>initValue</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Compute a checksum of binary string <em>string</em> using the
Adler-32 algorithm. If given, <em>initValue</em> is used to initialize
the checksum engine.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>zlib crc32</strong> <em>string</em>
?<em>initValue</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Compute a checksum of binary string <em>string</em> using the CRC-32
algorithm. If given, <em>initValue</em> is used to initialize the
checksum engine.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="streaming-instance-command">STREAMING INSTANCE COMMAND</h1>
<p>Streaming compression instance commands are produced by the
<strong>zlib stream</strong> command. They are used by calling their
<strong>put</strong> subcommand one or more times to load data in, and
their <strong>get</strong> subcommand one or more times to extract the
transformed data.</p>
<p>The full set of subcommands supported by a streaming instance
command, <em>stream</em>, is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>add</strong> ?<em>option...</em>?
<em>data</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>A short-cut for followed by</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>checksum</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the checksum of the uncompressed data seen so far by this
stream.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>close</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Deletes this stream and frees up all resources associated with
it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>eof</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a boolean indicating whether the end of the stream (as
determined by the compressed data itself) has been reached. Not all
formats support detection of the end of the stream.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>finalize</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A short-cut for</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>flush</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A short-cut for</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>fullflush</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A short-cut for</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>get</strong> ?<em>count</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Return up to <em>count</em> bytes from <em>stream</em>'s internal
buffers with the transformation applied. If <em>count</em> is omitted,
the entire contents of the buffers are returned. <em>stream</em>
<strong>header</strong> Return the gzip header description dictionary
extracted from the stream. Only supported for streams created with their
<em>mode</em> parameter set to <strong>gunzip</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>put</strong> ?<em>option...</em>?
<em>data</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Append the contents of the binary string <em>data</em> to
<em>stream</em>'s internal buffers while applying the transformation.
The following <em>option</em>s are supported (or an unambiguous prefix
of them), which are used to modify the way in which the transformation
is applied:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-dictionary</strong> <em>binData</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sets the compression dictionary to use when working with compressing
or decompressing the data to be <em>binData</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-finalize</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Mark the stream as finished, ensuring that all bytes have been wholly
compressed or decompressed. For gzip streams, this also ensures that the
footer is written to the stream. The stream will need to be reset before
having more data written to it after this, though data can still be read
out of the stream with the <strong>get</strong> subcommand.</p>
<p>This option is mutually exclusive with the <strong>-flush</strong>
and <strong>-fullflush</strong> options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-flush</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ensure that a decompressor consuming the bytes that the current
(compressing) stream is producing will be able to produce all the bytes
that have been compressed so far, at some performance penalty.</p>
<p>This option is mutually exclusive with the <strong>-finalize</strong>
and <strong>-fullflush</strong> options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-fullflush</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ensure that not only can a decompressor handle all the bytes produced
so far (as with <strong>-flush</strong> above) but also that it can
restart from this point if it detects that the stream is partially
corrupt. This incurs a substantial performance penalty.</p>
<p>This option is mutually exclusive with the <strong>-finalize</strong>
and <strong>-flush</strong> options.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>stream</em> <strong>reset</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Puts any stream, including those that have been finalized or that
have reached eof, back into a state where it can process more data.
Throws away all internally buffered data.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>To compress a Tcl string, it should be first converted to a
particular charset encoding since the <strong>zlib</strong> command
always operates on binary strings.</p>
<pre><code>set binData [encoding convertto utf-8 $string]
set compData [zlib compress $binData]</code></pre>
<p>When converting back, it is also important to reverse the charset
encoding:</p>
<pre><code>set binData [zlib decompress $compData]
set string [encoding convertfrom utf-8 $binData]</code></pre>
<p>The compression operation from above can also be done with streams,
which is especially helpful when you want to accumulate the data by
stages:</p>
<pre><code>set strm [zlib stream compress]
$strm put [encoding convertto utf-8 $string]
# ...
$strm finalize
set compData [$strm get]
$strm close</code></pre>
