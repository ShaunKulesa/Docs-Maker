<p>glob - Return names of files that match patterns</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>glob</strong> ?<em>switches</em>? ?<em>pattern ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command performs file name in a fashion similar to the csh shell
or bash shell. It returns a list of the files whose names match any of
the <em>pattern</em> arguments. No particular order is guaranteed in the
list, so if a sorted list is required the caller should use
<strong>lsort</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>
<p>If the initial arguments to <strong>glob</strong> start with
<strong>-</strong> then they are treated as switches. The following
switches are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-directory</strong> <em>directory</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Search for files which match the given patterns starting in the given
<em>directory</em>. This allows searching of directories whose name
contains glob-sensitive characters without the need to quote such
characters explicitly. This option may not be used in conjunction with
<strong>-path</strong>, which is used to allow searching for complete
file paths whose names may contain glob-sensitive characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-join</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The remaining pattern arguments, after option processing, are treated
as a single pattern obtained by joining the arguments with directory
separators.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-nocomplain</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows an empty list to be returned without error; without this
switch an error is returned if the result list would be empty.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-path</strong> <em>pathPrefix</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Search for files with the given <em>pathPrefix</em> where the rest of
the name matches the given patterns. This allows searching for files
with names similar to a given file (as opposed to a directory) even when
the names contain glob-sensitive characters. This option may not be used
in conjunction with <strong>-directory</strong>. For example, to find
all files with the same root name as $path, but differing extensions,
you should use which will work even if <strong>$path</strong> contains
numerous glob-sensitive characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-tails</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Only return the part of each file found which follows the last
directory named in any <strong>-directory</strong> or
<strong>-path</strong> path specification. Thus is equivalent to For
<strong>-path</strong> specifications, the returned names will include
the last path segment, so will return paths like <strong>foo.aux foo.bib
foo.tex</strong> etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-types</strong> <em>typeList</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Only list files or directories which match <em>typeList</em>, where
the items in the list have two forms. The first form is like the -type
option of the Unix find command: <em>b</em> (block special file),
<em>c</em> (character special file), <em>d</em> (directory), <em>f</em>
(plain file), <em>l</em> (symbolic link), <em>p</em> (named pipe), or
<em>s</em> (socket), where multiple types may be specified in the list.
<strong>Glob</strong> will return all files which match at least one of
the types given. Note that symbolic links will be returned both if
<strong>-types l</strong> is given, or if the target of a link matches
the requested type. So, a link to a directory will be returned if
<strong>-types d</strong> was specified.</p>
<p>The second form specifies types where all the types given must match.
These are <em>r</em>, <em>w</em>, <em>x</em> as file permissions, and
<em>readonly</em>, <em>hidden</em> as special permission cases. On the
Macintosh, MacOS types and creators are also supported, where any item
which is four characters long is assumed to be a MacOS type
(e.g. <strong>TEXT</strong>). Items which are of the form <em>{macintosh
type XXXX}</em> or <em>{macintosh creator XXXX}</em> will match types or
creators respectively. Unrecognized types, or specifications of multiple
MacOS types/creators will signal an error.</p>
<p>The two forms may be mixed, so <strong>-types {d f r w}</strong> will
find all regular files OR directories that have both read AND write
permissions. The following are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>glob -type d *
glob */</code></pre>
<p>except that the first case doesn't return the trailing and is more
platform independent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>- -</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
treated as a <em>pattern</em> even if it starts with a
<strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="globbing-patterns">GLOBBING PATTERNS</h2>
<p>The <em>pattern</em> arguments may contain any of the following
special characters, which are a superset of those supported by
<strong>string match</strong>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>?</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches any single character.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>*</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>[</strong><em>chars</em><strong>]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches any single character in <em>chars</em>. If <em>chars</em>
contains a sequence of the form <em>a</em><strong>-</strong><em>b</em>
then any character between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (inclusive) will
match.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>\</strong><em>x</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches the character <em>x</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>{</strong><em>a</em><strong>,</strong><em>b</em><strong>,</strong><em>...</em>}</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches any of the sub-patterns <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, etc.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>On Unix, as with csh, a at the beginning of a file's name or just
after a must be matched explicitly or with a {} construct, unless the
<strong>-types hidden</strong> flag is given (since at the beginning of
a file's name indicates that it is hidden). On other platforms, files
beginning with a are handled no differently to any others, except the
special directories and which must be matched explicitly (this is to
avoid a recursive pattern like from recursing up the directory hierarchy
as well as down). In addition, all characters must be matched
explicitly.</p>
<p>If the first character in a <em>pattern</em> is then it refers to the
home directory for the user whose name follows the If the is followed
immediately by then the value of the HOME environment variable is
used.</p>
<p>The <strong>glob</strong> command differs from csh globbing in two
ways. First, it does not sort its result list (use the
<strong>lsort</strong> command if you want the list sorted). Second,
<strong>glob</strong> only returns the names of files that actually
exist; in csh no check for existence is made unless a pattern contains a
?, *, or [] construct.</p>
<p>When the <strong>glob</strong> command returns relative paths whose
filenames start with a tilde (for example through <strong>glob
*</strong> or <strong>glob -tails</strong>, the returned list will not
quote the tilde with This means care must be taken if those names are
later to be used with <strong>file join</strong>, to avoid them being
interpreted as absolute paths pointing to a given user's home
directory.</p>
<h1 id="windows-portability-issues">WINDOWS PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<p>For Windows UNC names, the servername and sharename components of the
path may not contain ?, *, or [] constructs. On Windows NT, if
<em>pattern</em> is of the form it refers to the home directory of the
user whose account information resides on the specified NT domain
server. Otherwise, user account information is obtained from the local
computer.</p>
<p>Since the backslash character has a special meaning to the glob
command, glob patterns containing Windows style path separators need
special care. The pattern is interpreted as where will match the single
character and will match the single character and will not be
interpreted as a wildcard character. One solution to this problem is to
use the Unix style forward slash as a path separator. Windows style
paths can be converted to Unix style paths with the command or</p>
