<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>gets - Read a line from a channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>gets</strong> <em>channelId</em> ?<em>varName</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command reads the next line from <em>channelId</em>, returns
everything in the line up to (but not including) the end-of-line
character(s), and discards the end-of-line character(s).</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> must be an identifier for an open channel such as
the Tcl standard input channel (<strong>stdin</strong>), the return
value from an invocation of <strong>open</strong> or
<strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a channel creation command
provided by a Tcl extension. The channel must have been opened for
input.</p>
<p>If <em>varName</em> is omitted the line is returned as the result of
the command. If <em>varName</em> is specified then the line is placed in
the variable by that name and the return value is a count of the number
of characters returned.</p>
<p>If end of file occurs while scanning for an end of line, the command
returns whatever input is available up to the end of file. If
<em>channelId</em> is in non-blocking mode and there is not a full line
of input available, the command returns an empty string and does not
consume any input. If <em>varName</em> is specified and an empty string
is returned in <em>varName</em> because of end-of-file or because of
insufficient data in non-blocking mode, then the return count is -1.
Note that if <em>varName</em> is not specified then the end-of-file and
no-full-line-available cases can produce the same results as if there
were an input line consisting only of the end-of-line character(s). The
<strong>eof</strong> and <strong>fblocked</strong> commands can be used
to distinguish these three cases.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This example reads a file one line at a time and prints it out with
the current line number attached to the start of each line.</p>
<pre><code>set chan [open &quot;some.file.txt&quot;]
set lineNumber 0
while {[gets $chan line] &gt;= 0} {
    puts &quot;[incr lineNumber]: $line&quot;
}
close $chan</code></pre>
