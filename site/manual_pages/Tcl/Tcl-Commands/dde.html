<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command allows an application to send Dynamic Data Exchange
(DDE) command when running under Microsoft Windows. Dynamic Data
Exchange is a mechanism where applications can exchange raw data. Each
DDE transaction needs a <em>service name</em> and a <em>topic</em>. Both
the <em>service name</em> and <em>topic</em> are application defined;
Tcl uses the service name <strong>TclEval</strong>, while the topic name
is the name of the interpreter given by <strong>dde servername</strong>.
Other applications have their own <em>service names</em> and
<em>topics</em>. For instance, Microsoft Excel has the service name
<strong>Excel</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="dde-commands">DDE COMMANDS</h1>
<p>The following commands are a subset of the full Dynamic Data Exchange
set of commands.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>dde servername</strong> ?<strong>-force</strong>?
?<strong>-handler</strong> <em>proc</em>? ?<strong>- -</strong>?
?<em>topic</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>dde servername</strong> registers the interpreter as a DDE
server with the service name <strong>TclEval</strong> and the topic name
specified by <em>topic</em>. If no <em>topic</em> is given, <strong>dde
servername</strong> returns the name of the current topic or the empty
string if it is not registered as a service. If the given <em>topic</em>
name is already in use, then a suffix of the form or is appended to the
name to make it unique. The command's result will be the name actually
used. The <strong>-force</strong> option is used to force registration
of precisely the given <em>topic</em> name.</p>
<p>The <strong>-handler</strong> option specifies a Tcl procedure that
will be called to process calls to the dde server. If the package has
been loaded into a safe interpreter then a <strong>-handler</strong>
procedure must be defined. The procedure is called with all the
arguments provided by the remote call.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>dde execute</strong> ?<strong>-async</strong>?
?<strong>-binary</strong>? <em>service topic data</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>dde execute</strong> takes the <em>data</em> and sends it to
the server indicated by <em>service</em> with the topic indicated by
<em>topic</em>. Typically, <em>service</em> is the name of an
application, and <em>topic</em> is a file to work on. The <em>data</em>
field is given to the remote application. Typically, the application
treats the <em>data</em> field as a script, and the script is run in the
application. The <strong>-async</strong> option requests asynchronous
invocation. The command returns an error message if the script did not
run, unless the <strong>-async</strong> flag was used, in which case the
command returns immediately with no error.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Without the <strong>-binary</strong> option all data will be sent in
unicode. For dde clients which don't implement the CF_UNICODE clipboard
format, this will automatically be translated to the system encoding.
You can use the <strong>-binary</strong> option in combination with the
result of <strong>encoding convertto</strong> to send data in any other
encoding.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>dde poke</strong> ?<strong>-binary</strong>? <em>service
topic item data</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>dde poke</strong> passes the <em>data</em> to the server
indicated by <em>service</em> using the <em>topic</em> and <em>item</em>
specified. Typically, <em>service</em> is the name of an application.
<em>topic</em> is application specific but can be a command to the
server or the name of a file to work on. The <em>item</em> is also
application specific and is often not used, but it must always be
non-null. The <em>data</em> field is given to the remote
application.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Without the <strong>-binary</strong> option all data will be sent in
unicode. For dde clients which don't implement the CF_UNICODE clipboard
format, this will automatically be translated to the system encoding.
You can use the <strong>-binary</strong> option in combination with the
result of <strong>encoding convertto</strong> to send data in any other
encoding.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>dde request</strong> ?<strong>-binary</strong>? <em>service
topic item</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>dde request</strong> is typically used to get the value of
something; the value of a cell in Microsoft Excel or the text of a
selection in Microsoft Word. <em>service</em> is typically the name of
an application, <em>topic</em> is typically the name of the file, and
<em>item</em> is application-specific. The command returns the value of
<em>item</em> as defined in the application. Normally this is
interpreted to be a string with terminating null. If
<strong>-binary</strong> is specified, the result is returned as a byte
array.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>dde services</strong> <em>service topic</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>dde services</strong> returns a list of service-topic pairs
that currently exist on the machine. If <em>service</em> and
<em>topic</em> are both empty strings ({}), then all service-topic pairs
currently available on the system are returned. If <em>service</em> is
empty and <em>topic</em> is not, then all services with the specified
topic are returned. If <em>service</em> is non-empty and <em>topic</em>
is, all topics for a given service are returned. If both are non-empty,
if that service-topic pair currently exists, it is returned; otherwise,
an empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>dde eval</strong> ?<strong>-async</strong>? <em>topic
cmd</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>dde eval</strong> evaluates a command and its arguments using
the interpreter specified by <em>topic</em>. The DDE service must be the
<strong>TclEval</strong> service. The <strong>-async</strong> option
requests asynchronous invocation. The command returns an error message
if the script did not run, unless the <strong>-async</strong> flag was
used, in which case the command returns immediately with no error. This
command can be used to replace send on Windows.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="dde-and-tcl">DDE AND TCL</h1>
<p>A Tcl interpreter always has a service name of
<strong>TclEval</strong>. Each different interpreter of all running Tcl
applications must be given a unique name specified by <strong>dde
servername</strong>. Each interp is available as a DDE topic only if the
<strong>dde servername</strong> command was used to set the name of the
topic for each interp. So a <strong>dde services TclEval {}</strong>
command will return a list of service-topic pairs, where each of the
currently running interps will be a topic.</p>
<p>When Tcl processes a <strong>dde execute</strong> command, the data
for the execute is run as a script in the interp named by the topic of
the <strong>dde execute</strong> command.</p>
<p>When Tcl processes a <strong>dde request</strong> command, it returns
the value of the variable given in the dde command in the context of the
interp named by the dde topic. Tcl reserves the variable
<strong>$TCLEVAL$EXECUTE$RESULT</strong> for internal use, and
<strong>dde request</strong> commands for that variable will give
unpredictable results.</p>
<p>An external application which wishes to run a script in Tcl should
have that script store its result in a variable, run the <strong>dde
execute</strong> command, and then run <strong>dde request</strong> to
get the value of the variable.</p>
<p>When using DDE, be careful to ensure that the event queue is flushed
using either <strong>update</strong> or <strong>vwait</strong>. This
happens by default when using <strong>wish</strong> unless a blocking
command is called (such as <strong>exec</strong> without adding the
<strong>&amp;</strong> to place the process in the background). If for
any reason the event queue is not flushed, DDE commands may hang until
the event queue is flushed. This can create a deadlock situation.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This asks Internet Explorer (which must already be running) to go to
a particularly important website:</p>
<pre><code>package require dde
dde execute -async iexplore WWW_OpenURL http://www.tcl-lang.org/</code></pre>
