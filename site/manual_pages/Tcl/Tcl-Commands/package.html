<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command keeps a simple database of the packages available for
use by the current interpreter and how to load them into the
interpreter. It supports multiple versions of each package and arranges
for the correct version of a package to be loaded based on what is
needed by the application. This command also detects and reports version
clashes. Typically, only the <strong>package require</strong> and
<strong>package provide</strong> commands are invoked in normal Tcl
scripts; the other commands are used primarily by system scripts that
maintain the package database.</p>
<p>The behavior of the <strong>package</strong> command is determined by
its first argument. The following forms are permitted:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>package forget</strong> ?<em>package package ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes all information about each specified package from this
interpreter, including information provided by both <strong>package
ifneeded</strong> and <strong>package provide</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package ifneeded</strong> <em>package version</em>
?<em>script</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command typically appears only in system configuration scripts
to set up the package database. It indicates that a particular version
of a particular package is available if needed, and that the package can
be added to the interpreter by executing <em>script</em>. The script is
saved in a database for use by subsequent <strong>package
require</strong> commands; typically, <em>script</em> sets up
auto-loading for the commands in the package (or calls
<strong>load</strong> and/or <strong>source</strong> directly), then
invokes <strong>package provide</strong> to indicate that the package is
present. There may be information in the database for several different
versions of a single package. If the database already contains
information for <em>package</em> and <em>version</em>, the new
<em>script</em> replaces the existing one. If the <em>script</em>
argument is omitted, the current script for version <em>version</em> of
package <em>package</em> is returned, or an empty string if no
<strong>package ifneeded</strong> command has been invoked for this
<em>package</em> and <em>version</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package names</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of the names of all packages in the interpreter for
which a version has been provided (via <strong>package provide</strong>)
or for which a <strong>package ifneeded</strong> script is available.
The order of elements in the list is arbitrary.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package present</strong> ?<strong>-exact</strong>?
<em>package</em> ?<em>requirement...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is equivalent to <strong>package require</strong> except
that it does not try and load the package if it is not already
loaded.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package provide</strong> <em>package</em>
?<em>version</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is invoked to indicate that version <em>version</em> of
package <em>package</em> is now present in the interpreter. It is
typically invoked once as part of an <strong>ifneeded</strong> script,
and again by the package itself when it is finally loaded. An error
occurs if a different version of <em>package</em> has been provided by a
previous <strong>package provide</strong> command. If the
<em>version</em> argument is omitted, then the command returns the
version number that is currently provided, or an empty string if no
<strong>package provide</strong> command has been invoked for
<em>package</em> in this interpreter.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package require</strong> <em>package</em>
?<em>requirement...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is typically invoked by Tcl code that wishes to use a
particular version of a particular package. The arguments indicate which
package is wanted, and the command ensures that a suitable version of
the package is loaded into the interpreter. If the command succeeds, it
returns the version number that is loaded; otherwise it generates an
error.</p>
<p>A suitable version of the package is any version which satisfies at
least one of the requirements, per the rules of <strong>package</strong>
vsatisfies. If multiple versions are suitable the implementation with
the highest version is chosen. This last part is additionally influenced
by the selection mode set with <strong>package prefer</strong>.</p>
<p>In the selection mode the command will select the highest stable
version satisfying the requirements, if any. If no stable version
satisfies the requirements, the highest unstable version satisfying the
requirements will be selected. In the selection mode the command will
accept the highest version satisfying all the requirements, regardless
of its stableness.</p>
<p>If a version of <em>package</em> has already been provided (by
invoking the <strong>package provide</strong> command), then its version
number must satisfy the <em>requirement</em>s and the command returns
immediately. Otherwise, the command searches the database of information
provided by previous <strong>package ifneeded</strong> commands to see
if an acceptable version of the package is available. If so, the script
for the highest acceptable version number is evaluated in the global
namespace; it must do whatever is necessary to load the package,
including calling <strong>package provide</strong> for the package. If
the <strong>package ifneeded</strong> database does not contain an
acceptable version of the package and a <strong>package unknown</strong>
command has been specified for the interpreter then that command is
evaluated in the global namespace; when it completes, Tcl checks again
to see if the package is now provided or if there is a <strong>package
ifneeded</strong> script for it. If all of these steps fail to provide
an acceptable version of the package, then the command returns an
error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package require -exact</strong> <em>package
version</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This form of the command is used when only the given <em>version</em>
of <em>package</em> is acceptable to the caller. This command is
equivalent to <strong>package require</strong> <em>package
version</em>-<em>version</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package unknown</strong> ?<em>command</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command supplies a command to invoke during <strong>package
require</strong> if no suitable version of a package can be found in the
<strong>package ifneeded</strong> database. If the <em>command</em>
argument is supplied, it contains the first part of a command; when the
command is invoked during a <strong>package require</strong> command,
Tcl appends one or more additional arguments giving the desired package
name and requirements. For example, if <em>command</em> is <strong>foo
bar</strong> and later the command <strong>package require test
2.4</strong> is invoked, then Tcl will execute the command <strong>foo
bar test 2.4</strong> to load the package. If no requirements are
supplied to the <strong>package require</strong> command, then only the
name will be added to invoked command. If the <strong>package
unknown</strong> command is invoked without a <em>command</em> argument,
then the current <strong>package unknown</strong> script is returned, or
an empty string if there is none. If <em>command</em> is specified as an
empty string, then the current <strong>package unknown</strong> script
is removed, if there is one.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package vcompare</strong> <em>version1 version2</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compares the two version numbers given by <em>version1</em> and
<em>version2</em>. Returns -1 if <em>version1</em> is an earlier version
than <em>version2</em>, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if <em>version1</em>
is later than <em>version2</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package versions</strong> <em>package</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of all the version numbers of <em>package</em> for
which information has been provided by <strong>package ifneeded</strong>
commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package vsatisfies</strong> <em>version
requirement...</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if the <em>version</em> satisfies at least one of the given
requirements, and 0 otherwise. Each <em>requirement</em> is allowed to
have any of the forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>min</dt>
<dd>
<p>This form is called</p>
</dd>
<dt>min-</dt>

</dl>
<p>where and are valid version numbers. The legacy syntax is a special
case of the extended syntax, keeping backward compatibility. Regarding
satisfaction the rules are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>version</em> has to pass at least one of the listed
<em>requirement</em>s to be satisfactory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A version satisfies a requirement when</p>
<dl>
<dt>[a]</dt>
<dd>
<p>For <em>min</em> equal to the <em>max</em> if, and only if the
<em>version</em> is equal to the <em>min</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[b]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Otherwise if, and only if the <em>version</em> is greater than or
equal to the <em>min</em>, and less than the <em>max</em>, where both
<em>min</em> and <em>max</em> have been padded internally with Note that
while the comparison to <em>min</em> is inclusive, the comparison to
<em>max</em> is exclusive.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A requirement is a requirement in disguise, with the <em>max</em>
part implicitly specified as the next higher major version number of the
<em>min</em> part. A version satisfies it per the rules above.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <em>version</em> satisfies a requirement if, and only if it is
greater than or equal to the <em>min</em>, where the <em>min</em> has
been padded internally with There is no constraint to a maximum.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>package prefer</strong>
?<strong>latest</strong>|<strong>stable</strong>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>With no arguments, the commands returns either or whichever describes
the current mode of selection logic used by <strong>package
require</strong>.</p>
<p>When passed the argument it sets the selection logic mode to</p>
<p>When passed the argument if the mode is already that value is kept.
If the mode is already then the attempt to set it back to is ineffective
and the mode value remains</p>
<p>When passed any other value as an argument, raise an invalid argument
error.</p>
<p>When an interpreter is created, its initial selection mode value is
set to unless the environment variable
<strong>TCL_PKG_PREFER_LATEST</strong> is set. If that environment
variable is defined (with any value) then the initial (and permanent)
selection mode value is set to</p>

<h1 id="version-numbers">VERSION NUMBERS</h1>
<p>Version numbers consist of one or more decimal numbers separated by
dots, such as 2 or 1.162 or 3.1.13.1. The first number is called the
major version number. Larger numbers correspond to later versions of a
package, with leftmost numbers having greater significance. For example,
version 2.1 is later than 1.3 and version 3.4.6 is later than 3.3.5.
Missing fields are equivalent to zeroes: version 1.3 is the same as
version 1.3.0 and 1.3.0.0, so it is earlier than 1.3.1 or 1.3.0.2. In
addition, the letters (alpha) and/or (beta) may appear exactly once to
replace a dot for separation. These letters semantically add a negative
specifier into the version, where is -2, and is -1. Each may be
specified only once, and or are mutually exclusive in a specifier. Thus
1.3a1 becomes (semantically) 1.3.-2.1, 1.3b1 is 1.3.-1.1. Negative
numbers are not directly allowed in version specifiers. A version number
not containing the letters or as specified above is called a
<strong>stable</strong> version, whereas presence of the letters causes
the version to be called is <strong>unstable</strong>. A later version
number is assumed to be upwards compatible with an earlier version
number as long as both versions have the same major version number. For
example, Tcl scripts written for version 2.3 of a package should work
unchanged under versions 2.3.2, 2.4, and 2.5.1. Changes in the major
version number signify incompatible changes: if code is written to use
version 2.1 of a package, it is not guaranteed to work unmodified with
either version 1.7.3 or version 3.1.</p>
<h1 id="package-indices">PACKAGE INDICES</h1>
<p>The recommended way to use packages in Tcl is to invoke
<strong>package require</strong> and <strong>package provide</strong>
commands in scripts, and use the procedure <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>
to create package index files. Once you have done this, packages will be
loaded automatically in response to <strong>package require</strong>
commands. See the documentation for <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> for
details.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>To state that a Tcl script requires the Tk and http packages, put
this at the top of the script:</p>
<pre><code>package require Tk
package require http</code></pre>
<p>To test to see if the Snack package is available and load if it is
(often useful for optional enhancements to programs where the loss of
the functionality is not critical) do this:</p>
<pre><code>if {[catch {package require Snack}]} {
    # Error thrown - package not found.
    # Set up a dummy interface to work around the absence
} else {
    # We have the package, configure the app to use it
}</code></pre>
