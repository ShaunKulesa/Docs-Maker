<p>pkg_mkIndex - Build an index for automatic loading of packages</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>pkg_mkIndex ?options...? dir ?pattern pattern ...?</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Pkg_mkIndex</strong> is a utility procedure that is part of
the standard Tcl library. It is used to create index files that allow
packages to be loaded automatically when <strong>package
require</strong> commands are executed. To use
<strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>, follow these steps:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create the package(s). Each package may consist of one or more Tcl
script files or binary files. Binary files must be suitable for loading
with the <strong>load</strong> command with a single argument; for
example, if the file is <strong>test.so</strong> it must be possible to
load this file with the command <strong>load test.so</strong>. Each
script file must contain a <strong>package provide</strong> command to
declare the package and version number, and each binary file must
contain a call to <strong>Tcl_PkgProvide</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create the index by invoking <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>. The
<em>dir</em> argument gives the name of a directory and each
<em>pattern</em> argument is a <strong>glob</strong>-style pattern that
selects script or binary files in <em>dir</em>. The default pattern is
<strong>*.tcl</strong> and <strong>*.[info
sharedlibextension]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Pkg_mkIndex</strong> will create a file
<strong>pkgIndex.tcl</strong> in <em>dir</em> with package information
about all the files given by the <em>pattern</em> arguments. It does
this by loading each file into a child interpreter and seeing what
packages and new commands appear (this is why it is essential to have
<strong>package provide</strong> commands or
<strong>Tcl_PkgProvide</strong> calls in the files, as described above).
If you have a package split among scripts and binary files, or if you
have dependencies among files, you may have to use the
<strong>-load</strong> option or adjust the order in which
<strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> processes the files. See <strong>COMPLEX
CASES</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Install the package as a subdirectory of one of the directories given
by the <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong> variable. If
<strong>$tcl_pkgPath</strong> contains more than one directory,
machine-dependent packages (e.g., those that contain binary shared
libraries) should normally be installed under the first directory and
machine-independent packages (e.g., those that contain only Tcl scripts)
should be installed under the second directory. The subdirectory should
include the package's script and/or binary files as well as the
<strong>pkgIndex.tcl</strong> file. As long as the package is installed
as a subdirectory of a directory in <strong>$tcl_pkgPath</strong> it
will automatically be found during <strong>package require</strong>
commands.</p>
<p>If you install the package anywhere else, then you must ensure that
the directory containing the package is in the
<strong>auto_path</strong> global variable or an immediate subdirectory
of one of the directories in <strong>auto_path</strong>.
<strong>Auto_path</strong> contains a list of directories that are
searched by both the auto-loader and the package loader; by default it
includes <strong>$tcl_pkgPath</strong>. The package loader also checks
all of the subdirectories of the directories in
<strong>auto_path</strong>. You can add a directory to
<strong>auto_path</strong> explicitly in your application, or you can
add the directory to your <strong>TCLLIBPATH</strong> environment
variable: if this environment variable is present, Tcl initializes
<strong>auto_path</strong> from it during application startup.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once the above steps have been taken, all you need to do to use a
package is to invoke <strong>package require</strong>. For example, if
versions 2.1, 2.3, and 3.1 of package <strong>Test</strong> have been
indexed by <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>, the command <strong>package
require Test</strong> will make version 3.1 available and the command
<strong>package require -exact Test 2.1</strong> will make version 2.1
available. There may be many versions of a package in the various index
files in <strong>auto_path</strong>, but only one will actually be
loaded in a given interpreter, based on the first call to
<strong>package require</strong>. Different versions of a package may be
loaded in different interpreters.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="options">OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The optional switches are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-direct</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The generated index will implement direct loading of the package upon
<strong>package require</strong>. This is the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-lazy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The generated index will manage to delay loading the package until
the use of one of the commands provided by the package, instead of
loading it immediately upon <strong>package require</strong>. This is
not compatible with the use of <em>auto_reset</em>, and therefore its
use is discouraged.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-load</strong> <em>pkgPat</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The index process will pre-load any packages that exist in the
current interpreter and match <em>pkgPat</em> into the child interpreter
used to generate the index. The pattern match uses string match rules,
but without making case distinctions. See <strong>COMPLEX CASES</strong>
below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-verbose</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate output during the indexing process. Output is via the
<strong>tclLog</strong> procedure, which by default prints to
stderr.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>End of the flags, in case <em>dir</em> begins with a dash.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="packages-and-the-auto-loader">PACKAGES AND THE AUTO-LOADER</h1>
<p>The package management facilities overlap somewhat with the
auto-loader, in that both arrange for files to be loaded on-demand.
However, package management is a higher-level mechanism that uses the
auto-loader for the last step in the loading process. It is generally
better to index a package with <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> rather than
<strong>auto_mkindex</strong> because the package mechanism provides
version control: several versions of a package can be made available in
the index files, with different applications using different versions
based on <strong>package require</strong> commands. In contrast,
<strong>auto_mkindex</strong> does not understand versions so it can
only handle a single version of each package. It is probably not a good
idea to index a given package with both <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> and
<strong>auto_mkindex</strong>. If you use <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>
to index a package, its commands cannot be invoked until <strong>package
require</strong> has been used to select a version; in contrast,
packages indexed with <strong>auto_mkindex</strong> can be used
immediately since there is no version control.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-works">HOW IT WORKS</h1>
<p><strong>Pkg_mkIndex</strong> depends on the <strong>package
unknown</strong> command, the <strong>package ifneeded</strong> command,
and the auto-loader. The first time a <strong>package require</strong>
command is invoked, the <strong>package unknown</strong> script is
invoked. This is set by Tcl initialization to a script that evaluates
all of the <strong>pkgIndex.tcl</strong> files in the
<strong>auto_path</strong>. The <strong>pkgIndex.tcl</strong> files
contain <strong>package ifneeded</strong> commands for each version of
each available package; these commands invoke <strong>package
provide</strong> commands to announce the availability of the package,
and they setup auto-loader information to load the files of the package.
If the <strong>-lazy</strong> flag was provided when the
<strong>pkgIndex.tcl</strong> was generated, a given file of a given
version of a given package is not actually loaded until the first time
one of its commands is invoked. Thus, after invoking <strong>package
require</strong> you may not see the package's commands in the
interpreter, but you will be able to invoke the commands and they will
be auto-loaded.</p>
<h1 id="direct-loading">DIRECT LOADING</h1>
<p>Some packages, for instance packages which use namespaces and export
commands or those which require special initialization, might select
that their package files be loaded immediately upon <strong>package
require</strong> instead of delaying the actual loading to the first use
of one of the package's command. This is the default mode when
generating the package index. It can be overridden by specifying the
<strong>-lazy</strong> argument.</p>
<h1 id="complex-cases">COMPLEX CASES</h1>
<p>Most complex cases of dependencies among scripts and binary files,
and packages being split among scripts and binary files are handled OK.
However, you may have to adjust the order in which files are processed
by <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>. These issues are described in detail
below.</p>
<p>If each script or file contains one package, and packages are only
contained in one file, then things are easy. You simply specify all
files to be indexed in any order with some glob patterns.</p>
<p>In general, it is OK for scripts to have dependencies on other
packages. If scripts contain <strong>package require</strong> commands,
these are stubbed out in the interpreter used to process the scripts, so
these do not cause problems. If scripts call into other packages in
global code, these calls are handled by a stub <strong>unknown</strong>
command. However, if scripts make variable references to other package's
variables in global code, these will cause errors. That is also bad
coding style.</p>
<p>If binary files have dependencies on other packages, things can
become tricky because it is not possible to stub out C-level APIs such
as <strong>Tcl_PkgRequire</strong> API when loading a binary file. For
example, suppose the BLT package requires Tk, and expresses this with a
call to <strong>Tcl_PkgRequire</strong> in its <strong>Blt_Init</strong>
routine. To support this, you must run <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> in
an interpreter that has Tk loaded. You can achieve this with the
<strong>-load</strong> <em>pkgPat</em> option. If you specify this
option, <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> will load any packages listed by
<strong>info loaded</strong> and that match <em>pkgPat</em> into the
interpreter used to process files. In most cases this will satisfy the
<strong>Tcl_PkgRequire</strong> calls made by binary files.</p>
<p>If you are indexing two binary files and one depends on the other,
you should specify the one that has dependencies last. This way the one
without dependencies will get loaded and indexed, and then the package
it provides will be available when the second file is processed. You may
also need to load the first package into the temporary interpreter used
to create the index by using the <strong>-load</strong> flag; it will
not hurt to specify package patterns that are not yet loaded.</p>
<p>If you have a package that is split across scripts and a binary file,
then you should avoid the <strong>-load</strong> flag. The problem is
that if you load a package before computing the index it masks any other
files that provide part of the same package. If you must use
<strong>-load</strong>, then you must specify the scripts first;
otherwise the package loaded from the binary file may mask the package
defined by the scripts.</p>
