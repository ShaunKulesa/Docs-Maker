<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>oo::define</strong> command is used to control the
configuration of classes, and the <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> command
is used to control the configuration of objects (including classes as
instance objects), with the configuration being applied to the entity
named in the <em>class</em> or the <em>object</em> argument. Configuring
a class also updates the configuration of all subclasses of the class
and all objects that are instances of that class or which mix it in (as
modified by any per-instance configuration). The way in which the
configuration is done is controlled by either the <em>defScript</em>
argument or by the <em>subcommand</em> and following <em>arg</em>
arguments; when the second is present, it is exactly as if all the
arguments from <em>subcommand</em> onwards are made into a list and that
list is used as the <em>defScript</em> argument.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-classes">CONFIGURING CLASSES</h2>
<p>The following commands are supported in the <em>defScript</em> for
<strong>oo::define</strong>, each of which may also be used in the
<em>subcommand</em> form:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>constructor</strong> <em>argList bodyScript</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates or updates the constructor for a class. The formal
arguments to the constructor (defined using the same format as for the
Tcl <strong>proc</strong> command) will be <em>argList</em>, and the
body of the constructor will be <em>bodyScript</em>. When the body of
the constructor is evaluated, the current namespace of the constructor
will be a namespace that is unique to the object being constructed.
Within the constructor, the <strong>next</strong> command should be used
to call the superclasses' constructors. If <em>bodyScript</em> is the
empty string, the constructor will be deleted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>deletemethod</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This deletes each of the methods called <em>name</em> from a class.
The methods must have previously existed in that class. Does not affect
the superclasses of the class, nor does it affect the subclasses or
instances of the class (except when they have a call chain through the
class being modified) or the class object itself.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>destructor</strong> <em>bodyScript</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates or updates the destructor for a class. Destructors take
no arguments, and the body of the destructor will be
<em>bodyScript</em>. The destructor is called when objects of the class
are deleted, and when called will have the object's unique namespace as
the current namespace. Destructors should use the <strong>next</strong>
command to call the superclasses' destructors. Note that destructors are
not called in all situations (e.g. if the interpreter is destroyed). If
<em>bodyScript</em> is the empty string, the destructor will be
deleted.</p>
<p>Note that errors during the evaluation of a destructor <em>are not
returned</em> to the code that causes the destruction of an object.
Instead, they are passed to the currently-defined
<strong>bgerror</strong> handler.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>export</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be
exported (i.e. usable outside an instance through the instance object's
command) by the class being defined. Note that the methods themselves
may be actually defined by a superclass; subclass exports override
superclass visibility, and may in turn be overridden by instances.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>filter</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>methodName
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates the list of method names that are used to guard
whether method call to instances of the class may be called and what the
method's results are. Each <em>methodName</em> names a single filtering
method (which may be exposed or not exposed); it is not an error for a
non-existent method to be named since they may be defined by
subclasses.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by appending.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>forward</strong> <em>name cmdName</em> ?<em>arg
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates or updates a forwarded method called <em>name</em>. The
method is defined be forwarded to the command called <em>cmdName</em>,
with additional arguments, <em>arg</em> etc., added before those
arguments specified by the caller of the method. The <em>cmdName</em>
will always be resolved using the rules of the invoking objects'
namespaces, i.e., when <em>cmdName</em> is not fully-qualified, the
command will be searched for in each object's namespace, using the
instances' namespace's path, or by looking in the global namespace. The
method will be exported if <em>name</em> starts with a lower-case
letter, and non-exported otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>method</strong> <em>name argList bodyScript</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates or updates a method that is implemented as a
procedure-like script. The name of the method is <em>name</em>, the
formal arguments to the method (defined using the same format as for the
Tcl <strong>proc</strong> command) will be <em>argList</em>, and the
body of the method will be <em>bodyScript</em>. When the body of the
method is evaluated, the current namespace of the method will be a
namespace that is unique to the current object. The method will be
exported if <em>name</em> starts with a lower-case letter, and
non-exported otherwise; this behavior can be overridden via
<strong>export</strong> and <strong>unexport</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>mixin</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>className
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates the list of additional classes that are to be mixed
into all the instances of the class being defined. Each
<em>className</em> argument names a single class that is to be mixed
in.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by replacement.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>renamemethod</strong> <em>fromName toName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This renames the method called <em>fromName</em> in a class to
<em>toName</em>. The method must have previously existed in the class,
and <em>toName</em> must not previously refer to a method in that class.
Does not affect the superclasses of the class, nor does it affect the
subclasses or instances of the class (except when they have a call chain
through the class being modified), or the class object itself. Does not
change the export status of the method; if it was exported before, it
will be afterwards.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>self</strong> <em>subcommand arg ...</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>self</strong> <em>script</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is equivalent to calling <strong>oo::objdefine</strong>
on the class being defined (see <strong>CONFIGURING OBJECTS</strong>
below for a description of the supported values of <em>subcommand</em>).
It follows the same general pattern of argument handling as the
<strong>oo::define</strong> and <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> commands,
and operates identically to</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>superclass</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>className
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>allows the alteration of the superclasses of the class being defined.
Each <em>className</em> argument names one class that is to be a
superclass of the defined class. Note that objects must not be changed
from being classes to being non-classes or vice-versa, that an empty
parent class is equivalent to <strong>oo::object</strong>, and that the
parent classes of <strong>oo::object</strong> and
<strong>oo::class</strong> may not be modified.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by replacement.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>unexport</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be not
exported (i.e. not usable outside the instance through the instance
object's command, but instead just through the <strong>my</strong>
command visible in each object's context) by the class being defined.
Note that the methods themselves may be actually defined by a
superclass; subclass unexports override superclass visibility, and may
be overridden by instance unexports.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>variable</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>name
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below) arranges
for each of the named variables to be automatically made available in
the methods, constructor and destructor declared by the class being
defined. Each variable name must not have any namespace separators and
must not look like an array access. All variables will be actually
present in the instance object on which the method is executed. Note
that the variable lists declared by a superclass or subclass are
completely disjoint, as are variable lists declared by instances; the
list of variable names is just for methods (and constructors and
destructors) declared by this class. By default, this slot works by
appending.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-objects">CONFIGURING OBJECTS</h2>
<p>The following commands are supported in the <em>defScript</em> for
<strong>oo::objdefine</strong>, each of which may also be used in the
<em>subcommand</em> form:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>class</strong> <em>className</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This allows the class of an object to be changed after creation. Note
that the class's constructors are not called when this is done, and so
the object may well be in an inconsistent state unless additional
configuration work is done.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>deletemethod</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name ...</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This deletes each of the methods called <em>name</em> from an object.
The methods must have previously existed in that object (e.g., because
it was created through <strong>oo::objdefine method</strong>). Does not
affect the classes that the object is an instance of, or remove the
exposure of those class-provided methods in the instance of that
class.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>export</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be
exported (i.e. usable outside the object through the object's command)
by the object being defined. Note that the methods themselves may be
actually defined by a class or superclass; object exports override class
visibility.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>filter</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>methodName
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates the list of method names that are used to guard
whether a method call to the object may be called and what the method's
results are. Each <em>methodName</em> names a single filtering method
(which may be exposed or not exposed); it is not an error for a
non-existent method to be named. Note that the actual list of filters
also depends on the filters set upon any classes that the object is an
instance of.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by appending.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>forward</strong> <em>name cmdName</em> ?<em>arg
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates or updates a forwarded object method called
<em>name</em>. The method is defined be forwarded to the command called
<em>cmdName</em>, with additional arguments, <em>arg</em> etc., added
before those arguments specified by the caller of the method. Forwarded
methods should be deleted using the <strong>method</strong> subcommand.
The method will be exported if <em>name</em> starts with a lower-case
letter, and non-exported otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>method</strong> <em>name argList bodyScript</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates, updates or deletes an object method. The name of the
method is <em>name</em>, the formal arguments to the method (defined
using the same format as for the Tcl <strong>proc</strong> command) will
be <em>argList</em>, and the body of the method will be
<em>bodyScript</em>. When the body of the method is evaluated, the
current namespace of the method will be a namespace that is unique to
the object. The method will be exported if <em>name</em> starts with a
lower-case letter, and non-exported otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>mixin</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>className
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates a per-object list of additional classes that are to
be mixed into the object. Each argument, <em>className</em>, names a
single class that is to be mixed in.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by replacement.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>renamemethod</strong> <em>fromName toName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This renames the method called <em>fromName</em> in an object to
<em>toName</em>. The method must have previously existed in the object,
and <em>toName</em> must not previously refer to a method in that
object. Does not affect the classes that the object is an instance of
and cannot rename in an instance object the methods provided by those
classes (though a <strong>oo::objdefine forward</strong>ed method may
provide an equivalent capability). Does not change the export status of
the method; if it was exported before, it will be afterwards.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>unexport</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be not
exported (i.e. not usable outside the object through the object's
command, but instead just through the <strong>my</strong> command
visible in the object's context) by the object being defined. Note that
the methods themselves may be actually defined by a class; instance
unexports override class visibility.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>variable</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>name
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below) arranges
for each of the named variables to be automatically made available in
the methods declared by the object being defined. Each variable name
must not have any namespace separators and must not look like an array
access. All variables will be actually present in the object on which
the method is executed. Note that the variable lists declared by the
classes and mixins of which the object is an instance are completely
disjoint; the list of variable names is just for methods declared by
this object. By default, this slot works by appending.</p>
<h1 id="slotted-definitions">SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</h1>
<p>Some of the configurable definitions of a class or object are
<em>slotted</em> definitions. This means that the configuration is
implemented by a slot object, that is an instance of the class
<strong>oo::Slot</strong>, which manages a list of values (class names,
variable names, etc.) that comprises the contents of the slot. The class
defines three operations (as methods) that may be done on the slot:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>slot</em> <strong>-append</strong> ?<em>member ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This appends the given <em>member</em> elements to the slot
definition.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>slot</em> <strong>-clear</strong></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This sets the slot definition to the empty list.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>slot</em> <strong>-set</strong> ?<em>member ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This replaces the slot definition with the given <em>member</em>
elements.</p>
<p>A consequence of this is that any use of a slot's default operation
where the first member argument begins with a hyphen will be an error.
One of the above operations should be used explicitly in those
circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="slot-implementation">SLOT IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p>Internally, slot objects also define a method
<strong>--default-operation</strong> which is forwarded to the default
operation of the slot (thus, for the class slot, this is forwarded to
and these methods which provide the implementation interface:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>slot</em> <strong>Get</strong></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Returns a list that is the current contents of the slot. This method
must always be called from a stack frame created by a call to
<strong>oo::define</strong> or <strong>oo::objdefine</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>slot</em> <strong>Set</strong> <em>elementList</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sets the contents of the slot to the list <em>elementList</em> and
returns the empty string. This method must always be called from a stack
frame created by a call to <strong>oo::define</strong> or
<strong>oo::objdefine</strong>.</p>
<p>The implementation of these methods is slot-dependent (and
responsible for accessing the correct part of the class or object
definition). Slots also have an unknown method handler to tie all these
pieces together, and they hide their <strong>destroy</strong> method so
that it is not invoked inadvertently. It is <em>recommended</em> that
any user changes to the slot mechanism be restricted to defining new
operations whose names start with a hyphen.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to use both forms of the
<strong>oo::define</strong> and <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> commands
(they work in the same way), as well as illustrating four of the
subcommands of them.</p>
<pre><code>oo::class create c
c create o
oo::define c method foo {} {
    puts &quot;world&quot;
}
oo::objdefine o {
    method bar {} {
        my Foo &quot;hello &quot;
        my foo
    }
    forward Foo ::puts -nonewline
    unexport foo
}
o bar                → prints &quot;hello world&quot;
o foo                → error &quot;unknown method foo&quot;
o Foo Bar            → error &quot;unknown method Foo&quot;
oo::objdefine o renamemethod bar lollipop
o lollipop           → prints &quot;hello world&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This example shows how additional classes can be mixed into an
object. It also shows how <strong>mixin</strong> is a slot that supports
appending:</p>
<pre><code>oo::object create inst
inst m1              → error &quot;unknown method m1&quot;
inst m2              → error &quot;unknown method m2&quot;

oo::class create A {
    method m1 {} {
        puts &quot;red brick&quot;
    }
}
oo::objdefine inst {
    mixin A
}
inst m1              → prints &quot;red brick&quot;
inst m2              → error &quot;unknown method m2&quot;

oo::class create B {
    method m2 {} {
        puts &quot;blue brick&quot;
    }
}
oo::objdefine inst {
    mixin -append B
}
inst m1              → prints &quot;red brick&quot;
inst m2              → prints &quot;blue brick&quot;</code></pre>
