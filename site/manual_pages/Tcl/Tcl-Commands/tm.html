<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This document describes the facilities for locating and loading Tcl
Modules (see <strong>MODULE DEFINITION</strong> for the definition of a
Tcl Module). The following commands are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>::tcl::tm::path add</strong> ?<em>path</em>...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The paths are added at the head to the list of module paths, in order
of appearance. This means that the last argument ends up as the new head
of the list.</p>
<p>The command enforces the restriction that no path may be an ancestor
directory of any other path on the list. If any of the new paths
violates this restriction an error will be raised, before any of the
paths have been added. In other words, if only one path argument
violates the restriction then none will be added.</p>
<p>If a path is already present as is, no error will be raised and no
action will be taken.</p>
<p>Paths are searched later in the order of their appearance in the
list. As they are added to the front of the list they are searched in
reverse order of addition. In other words, the paths added last are
looked at first.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>::tcl::tm::path remove</strong> ?<em>path</em>...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes the paths from the list of module paths. The command silently
ignores all paths which are not on the list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>::tcl::tm::path list</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing all registered module paths, in the order
that they are searched for modules.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>::tcl::tm::roots</strong> ?<em>path</em>...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Similar to <strong>path add</strong>, and layered on top of it. This
command takes a list of paths, extends each with and for major version
<em>X</em> of the Tcl interpreter and minor version <em>y</em> less than
or equal to the minor version of the interpreter, and adds the resulting
set of paths to the list of paths to search.</p>
<p>This command is used internally by the system to set up the
system-specific default paths.</p>
<p>The command has been exposed to allow a build system to define
additional root paths beyond those described by this document.</p>

<h1 id="module-definition">MODULE DEFINITION</h1>
<p>A Tcl Module is a Tcl Package contained in a single file, and no
other files required by it. This file has to be
<strong>source</strong>able. In other words, a Tcl Module is always
imported via:</p>
<pre><code>source module_file</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>load</strong> command is not directly used. This
restriction is not an actual limitation, as some may believe. Ever since
8.4 the Tcl <strong>source</strong> command reads only until the first
^Z character. This allows us to combine an arbitrary Tcl script with
arbitrary binary data into one file, where the script processes the
attached data in any it chooses to fully import and activate the
package.</p>
<p>The name of a module file has to match the regular expression:</p>
<pre><code>([_[:alpha:]][:_[:alnum:]]*)-([[:digit:]].*)\.tm</code></pre>
<p>The first capturing parentheses provides the name of the package, the
second clause its version. In addition to matching the pattern, the
extracted version number must not raise an error when used in the
command:</p>
<pre><code>package vcompare $version 0</code></pre>
<h1 id="finding-modules">FINDING MODULES</h1>
<p>The directory tree for storing Tcl modules is separate from other
parts of the filesystem and independent of
<strong>auto_path</strong>.</p>
<p>Tcl Modules are searched for in all directories listed in the result
of the command <strong>::tcl::tm::path list</strong>. This is called the
<em>Module path</em>. Neither the <strong>auto_path</strong> nor the
<strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong> variables are used. All directories on the
module path have to obey one restriction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any two directories, neither is an ancestor directory of the
other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is required to avoid ambiguities in package naming. If for
example the two directories and were on the path a package named
<strong>cool::ice</strong> could be found via the names
<strong>cool::ice</strong> or <strong>ice</strong>, the latter
potentially obscuring a package named <strong>ice</strong>,
unqualified.</p>
<p>Before the search is started, the name of the requested package is
translated into a partial path, using the following algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All occurrences of in the package name are replaced by the
appropriate directory separator character for the platform we are on. On
Unix, for example, this is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The requested package is <strong>encoding::base64</strong>. The
generated partial path is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this translation the package is looked for in all module paths,
by combining them one-by-one, first to last with the partial path to
form a complete search pattern. Note that the search algorithm rejects
all files where the filename does not match the regular expression given
in the section <strong>MODULE DEFINITION</strong>. For the remaining
files <em>provide scripts</em> are generated and added to the package
ifneeded database.</p>
<p>The algorithm falls back to the previous unknown handler when none of
the found module files satisfy the request. If the request was satisfied
the fall-back is ignored.</p>
<p>Note that packages in module form have <em>no</em> control over the
<em>index</em> and <em>provide script</em>s entered into the package
database for them. For a module file <strong>MF</strong> the <em>index
script</em> is always:</p>
<pre><code>package ifneeded PNAME PVERSION [list source MF]</code></pre>
<p>and the <em>provide script</em> embedded in the above is:</p>
<pre><code>source MF</code></pre>
<p>Both package name <strong>PNAME</strong> and package version
<strong>PVERSION</strong> are extracted from the filename
<strong>MF</strong> according to the definition below:</p>
<pre><code>MF = /module_path/PNAME′-PVERSION.tm</code></pre>
<p>Where <strong>PNAME′</strong> is the partial path of the module as
defined in section <strong>FINDING MODULES</strong>, and translated into
<strong>PNAME</strong> by changing all directory separators to and
<strong>module_path</strong> is the path (from the list of paths to
search) that we found the module file under.</p>
<p>Note also that we are here creating a connection between package
names and paths. Tcl is case-sensitive when it comes to comparing
package names, but there are filesystems which are not, like NTFS.
Luckily these filesystems do store the case of the name, despite not
using the information when comparing.</p>
<p>Given the above we allow the names for packages in Tcl modules to
have mixed-case, but also require that there are no collisions when
comparing names in a case-insensitive manner. In other words, if a
package <strong>Foo</strong> is deployed in the form of a Tcl Module,
packages like <strong>foo</strong>, <strong>fOo</strong>, etc. are not
allowed anymore.</p>
<h1 id="default-paths">DEFAULT PATHS</h1>
<p>The default list of paths on the module path is computed by a
<strong>tclsh</strong> as follows, where <em>X</em> is the major version
of the Tcl interpreter and <em>y</em> is less than or equal to the minor
version of the Tcl interpreter.</p>
<p>All the default paths are added to the module path, even those paths
which do not exist. Non-existent paths are filtered out during actual
searches. This enables a user to create one of the paths searched when
needed and all running applications will automatically pick up any
modules placed in them.</p>
<p>The paths are added in the order as they are listed below, and for
lists of paths defined by an environment variable in the order they are
found in the variable.</p>
<h2 id="system-specific-paths">SYSTEM SPECIFIC PATHS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>file normalize [info
library]/../tcl</strong><em>X</em><strong>/</strong><em>X</em><strong>.</strong><em>y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>In other words, the interpreter will look into a directory specified
by its major version and whose minor versions are less than or equal to
the minor version of the interpreter.</p>
<p>For example for Tcl 8.4 the paths searched are:</p>
<pre><code>[info library]/../tcl8/8.4
[info library]/../tcl8/8.3
[info library]/../tcl8/8.2
[info library]/../tcl8/8.1
[info library]/../tcl8/8.0</code></pre>
<p>This definition assumes that a package defined for Tcl
<em>X</em><strong>.</strong><em>y</em> can also be used by all
interpreters which have the same major number <em>X</em> and a minor
number greater than <em>y</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file normalize
EXEC/tcl</strong><em>X</em><strong>/</strong><em>X</em><strong>.</strong><em>y</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Where <strong>EXEC</strong> is <strong>file normalize [info
nameofexecutable]/../lib</strong> or <strong>file normalize
[::tcl::pkgconfig get libdir,runtime]</strong></p>
<p>This sets of paths is handled equivalently to the set coming before,
except that it is anchored in <strong>EXEC_PREFIX</strong>. For a build
with <strong>PREFIX</strong> = <strong>EXEC_PREFIX</strong> the two sets
are identical.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="site-specific-paths">SITE SPECIFIC PATHS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>file normalize [info
library]/../tcl</strong><em>X</em><strong>/site-tcl</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Note that this is always a single entry because <em>X</em> is always
a specific value (the current major version of Tcl).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="user-specific-paths">USER SPECIFIC PATHS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>$::env(TCL</strong><em>X</em><strong>_</strong><em>y</em><strong>_TM_PATH)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of paths, separated by either <strong>:</strong> (Unix) or
<strong>;</strong> (Windows). This is user and site specific as this
environment variable can be set not only by the user's profile, but by
system configuration scripts as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>$::env(TCL</strong><em>X</em><strong>.</strong><em>y</em><strong>_TM_PATH)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Same meaning and content as the previous variable. However the use of
dot '.' to separate major and minor version number makes this name less
to non-portable and its use is discouraged. Support of this variable has
been kept only for backward compatibility with the original
specification, i.e. TIP 189.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These paths are seen and therefore shared by all Tcl shells in the
<strong>$::env(PATH)</strong> of the user.</p>
<p>Note that <em>X</em> and <em>y</em> follow the general rules set out
above. In other words, Tcl 8.4, for example, will look at these 10
environment variables:</p>
<pre><code>$::env(TCL8.4_TM_PATH)  $::env(TCL8_4_TM_PATH)
$::env(TCL8.3_TM_PATH)  $::env(TCL8_3_TM_PATH)
$::env(TCL8.2_TM_PATH)  $::env(TCL8_2_TM_PATH)
$::env(TCL8.1_TM_PATH)  $::env(TCL8_1_TM_PATH)
$::env(TCL8.0_TM_PATH)  $::env(TCL8_0_TM_PATH)</code></pre>
