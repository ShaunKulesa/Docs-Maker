<p>flush - Flush buffered output for a channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>flush</strong> <em>channelId</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Flushes any output that has been buffered for <em>channelId</em>.</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> must be an identifier for an open channel such as
a Tcl standard channel (<strong>stdout</strong> or
<strong>stderr</strong>), the return value from an invocation of
<strong>open</strong> or <strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a
channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The channel must
have been opened for writing.</p>
<p>If the channel is in blocking mode the command does not return until
all the buffered output has been flushed to the channel. If the channel
is in nonblocking mode, the command may return before all buffered
output has been flushed; the remainder will be flushed in the background
as fast as the underlying file or device is able to absorb it.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>

<pre><code>puts -nonewline &quot;Please type your name: &quot;

gets stdin name
puts &quot;Hello there, $name!&quot;</code></pre>
