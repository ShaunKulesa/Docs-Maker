<p>switch - Evaluate one of several scripts, depending on a given
value</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>switch</strong> ?<em>options</em>? <em>string pattern
body</em> ?<em>pattern body</em> ...?</p>
<p><strong>switch</strong> ?<em>options</em>? <em>string</em>
{<em>pattern body</em> ?<em>pattern body</em> ...?}</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>switch</strong> command matches its <em>string</em>
argument against each of the <em>pattern</em> arguments in order. As
soon as it finds a <em>pattern</em> that matches <em>string</em> it
evaluates the following <em>body</em> argument by passing it recursively
to the Tcl interpreter and returns the result of that evaluation. If the
last <em>pattern</em> argument is <strong>default</strong> then it
matches anything. If no <em>pattern</em> argument matches
<em>string</em> and no default is given, then the
<strong>switch</strong> command returns an empty string.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments to <strong>switch</strong> start with
<strong>-</strong> then they are treated as options unless there are
exactly two arguments to <strong>switch</strong> (in which case the
first must the <em>string</em> and the second must be the
<em>pattern</em>/<em>body</em> list). The following options are
currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-exact</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use exact matching when comparing <em>string</em> to a pattern. This
is the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-glob</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When matching <em>string</em> to the patterns, use glob-style
matching (i.e. the same as implemented by the <strong>string
match</strong> command).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-regexp</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When matching <em>string</em> to the patterns, use regular expression
matching (as described in the <strong>re_syntax</strong> reference
page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-nocase</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes comparisons to be handled in a case-insensitive manner.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-matchvar</strong> <em>varName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option (only legal when <strong>-regexp</strong> is also
specified) specifies the name of a variable into which the list of
matches found by the regular expression engine will be written. The
first element of the list written will be the overall substring of the
input string (i.e. the <em>string</em> argument to
<strong>switch</strong>) matched, the second element of the list will be
the substring matched by the first capturing parenthesis in the regular
expression that matched, and so on. When a <strong>default</strong>
branch is taken, the variable will have the empty list written to it.
This option may be specified at the same time as the
<strong>-indexvar</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-indexvar</strong> <em>varName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option (only legal when <strong>-regexp</strong> is also
specified) specifies the name of a variable into which the list of
indices referring to matching substrings found by the regular expression
engine will be written. The first element of the list written will be a
two-element list specifying the index of the start and index of the
first character after the end of the overall substring of the input
string (i.e. the <em>string</em> argument to <strong>switch</strong>)
matched, in a similar way to the <strong>-indices</strong> option to the
<strong>regexp</strong> can obtain. Similarly, the second element of the
list refers to the first capturing parenthesis in the regular expression
that matched, and so on. When a <strong>default</strong> branch is
taken, the variable will have the empty list written to it. This option
may be specified at the same time as the <strong>-matchvar</strong>
option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>- -</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the end of options. The argument following this one will be
treated as <em>string</em> even if it starts with a <strong>-</strong>.
This is not required when the matching patterns and bodies are grouped
together in a single argument.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Two syntaxes are provided for the <em>pattern</em> and <em>body</em>
arguments. The first uses a separate argument for each of the patterns
and commands; this form is convenient if substitutions are desired on
some of the patterns or commands. The second form places all of the
patterns and commands together into a single argument; the argument must
have proper list structure, with the elements of the list being the
patterns and commands. The second form makes it easy to construct
multi-line switch commands, since the braces around the whole list make
it unnecessary to include a backslash at the end of each line. Since the
<em>pattern</em> arguments are in braces in the second form, no command
or variable substitutions are performed on them; this makes the behavior
of the second form different than the first form in some cases.</p>
<p>If a <em>body</em> is specified as it means that the <em>body</em>
for the next pattern should also be used as the body for this pattern
(if the next pattern also has a body of then the body after that is
used, and so on). This feature makes it possible to share a single
<em>body</em> among several patterns.</p>
<p>Beware of how you place comments in <strong>switch</strong> commands.
Comments should only be placed <strong>inside</strong> the execution
body of one of the patterns, and not intermingled with the patterns.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The <strong>switch</strong> command can match against variables and
not just literals, as shown here (the result is <em>2</em>):</p>
<pre><code>set foo &quot;abc&quot;
switch abc a - b {expr {1}} $foo {expr {2}} default {expr {3}}</code></pre>
<p>Using glob matching and the fall-through body is an alternative to
writing regular expressions with alternations, as can be seen here (this
returns <em>1</em>):</p>
<pre><code>switch -glob aaab {
    a*b     -
    b       {expr {1}}
    a*      {expr {2}}
    default {expr {3}}
}</code></pre>
<p>Whenever nothing matches, the <strong>default</strong> clause (which
must be last) is taken. This example has a result of <em>3</em>:</p>
<pre><code>switch xyz {
    a -
    b {
        # Correct Comment Placement
        expr {1}
    }
    c {
        expr {2}
    }
    default {
        expr {3}
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>When matching against regular expressions, information about what
exactly matched is easily obtained using the <strong>-matchvar</strong>
option:</p>
<pre><code>switch -regexp -matchvar foo -- $bar {
    a(b*)c {
        puts &quot;Found [string length [lindex $foo 1]] &#39;b&#39;s&quot;
    }
    d(e*)f(g*)h {
        puts &quot;Found [string length [lindex $foo 1]] &#39;e&#39;s and\
                [string length [lindex $foo 2]] &#39;g&#39;s&quot;
    }
}</code></pre>
