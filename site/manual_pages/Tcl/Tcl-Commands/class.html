<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Classes are objects that can manufacture other objects according to a
pattern stored in the factory object (the class). An instance of the
class is created by calling one of the class's factory methods,
typically either <strong>create</strong> if an explicit name is being
given, or <strong>new</strong> if an arbitrary unique name is to be
automatically selected.</p>
<p>The <strong>oo::class</strong> class is the class of all classes;
every class is an instance of this class, which is consequently an
instance of itself. This class is a subclass of
<strong>oo::object</strong>, so every class is also an object.
Additional metaclasses (i.e., classes of classes) can be defined if
necessary by subclassing <strong>oo::class</strong>. Note that the
<strong>oo::class</strong> object hides the <strong>new</strong> method
on itself, so new classes should always be made using the
<strong>create</strong> method.</p>
<h2 id="constructor">CONSTRUCTOR</h2>
<p>The constructor of the <strong>oo::class</strong> class takes an
optional argument which, if present, is sent to the
<strong>oo::define</strong> command (along with the name of the
newly-created class) to allow the class to be conveniently configured at
creation time.</p>
<h2 id="destructor">DESTRUCTOR</h2>
<p>The <strong>oo::class</strong> class does not define an explicit
destructor. However, when a class is destroyed, all its subclasses and
instances are also destroyed, along with all objects that it has been
mixed into.</p>
<h2 id="exported-methods">EXPORTED METHODS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><em>cls</em> <strong>create</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>arg
...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates a new instance of the class <em>cls</em> called
<em>name</em> (which is resolved within the calling context's namespace
if not fully qualified), passing the arguments, <em>arg ...</em>, to the
constructor, and (if that returns a successful result) returning the
fully qualified name of the created object (the result of the
constructor is ignored). If the constructor fails (i.e. returns a non-OK
result) then the object is destroyed and the error message is the result
of this method call.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>cls</em> <strong>new</strong> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates a new instance of the class <em>cls</em> with a new
unique name, passing the arguments, <em>arg ...</em>, to the
constructor, and (if that returns a successful result) returning the
fully qualified name of the created object (the result of the
constructor is ignored). If the constructor fails (i.e., returns a
non-OK result) then the object is destroyed and the error message is the
result of this method call.</p>
<p>Note that this method is not exported by the
<strong>oo::class</strong> object itself, so classes should not be
created using this method.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="non-exported-methods">NON-EXPORTED METHODS</h2>
<p>The <strong>oo::class</strong> class supports the following
non-exported methods:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>cls</em> <strong>createWithNamespace</strong> <em>name
nsName</em> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This creates a new instance of the class <em>cls</em> called
<em>name</em> (which is resolved within the calling context's namespace
if not fully qualified), passing the arguments, <em>arg ...</em>, to the
constructor, and (if that returns a successful result) returning the
fully qualified name of the created object (the result of the
constructor is ignored). The name of the instance's internal namespace
will be <em>nsName</em> unless that namespace already exists (when an
arbitrary name will be chosen instead). If the constructor fails (i.e.,
returns a non-OK result) then the object is destroyed and the error
message is the result of this method call.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example defines a simple class hierarchy and creates a new
instance of it. It then invokes a method of the object before destroying
the hierarchy and showing that the destruction is transitive.</p>
<pre><code>oo::class create fruit {
    method eat {} {
        puts &quot;yummy!&quot;
    }
}
oo::class create banana {
    superclass fruit
    constructor {} {
        my variable peeled
        set peeled 0
    }
    method peel {} {
        my variable peeled
        set peeled 1
        puts &quot;skin now off&quot;
    }
    method edible? {} {
        my variable peeled
        return $peeled
    }
    method eat {} {
        if {![my edible?]} {
            my peel
        }
        next
    }
}
set b [banana new]
$b eat               → prints &quot;skin now off&quot; and &quot;yummy!&quot;
fruit destroy
$b eat               → error &quot;unknown command&quot;</code></pre>
