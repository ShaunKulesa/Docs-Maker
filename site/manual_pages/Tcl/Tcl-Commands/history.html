<p><strong>history</strong> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>history</strong> command performs one of several
operations related to recently-executed commands recorded in a history
list. Each of these recorded commands is referred to as an When
specifying an event to the <strong>history</strong> command, the
following forms may be used:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A number: if positive, it refers to the event with that number (all
events are numbered starting at 1). If the number is negative, it
selects an event relative to the current event (<strong>-1</strong>
refers to the previous event, <strong>-2</strong> to the one before
that, and so on). Event <strong>0</strong> refers to the current
event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>A string: selects the most recent event that matches the string. An
event is considered to match the string either if the string is the same
as the first characters of the event, or if the string matches the event
in the sense of the <strong>string match</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>history</strong> command can take any of the following
forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>history</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as <strong>history info</strong>, described below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history add</strong> <em>command</em>
?<strong>exec</strong>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds the <em>command</em> argument to the history list as a new
event. If <strong>exec</strong> is specified (or abbreviated) then the
command is also executed and its result is returned. If
<strong>exec</strong> is not specified then an empty string is returned
as result.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history change</strong> <em>newValue</em>
?<em>event</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Replaces the value recorded for an event with <em>newValue</em>.
<em>Event</em> specifies the event to replace, and defaults to the
<em>current</em> event (not event <strong>-1</strong>). This command is
intended for use in commands that implement new forms of history
substitution and wish to replace the current event (which invokes the
substitution) with the command created through substitution. The return
value is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history clear</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Erase the history list. The current keep limit is retained. The
history event numbers are reset.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history event</strong> ?<em>event</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the value of the event given by <em>event</em>.
<em>Event</em> defaults to <strong>-1</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history info</strong> ?<em>count</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a formatted string (intended for humans to read) giving the
event number and contents for each of the events in the history list
except the current event. If <em>count</em> is specified then only the
most recent <em>count</em> events are returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history keep</strong> ?<em>count</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command may be used to change the size of the history list to
<em>count</em> events. Initially, 20 events are retained in the history
list. If <em>count</em> is not specified, the current keep limit is
returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history nextid</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the number of the next event to be recorded in the history
list. It is useful for things like printing the event number in
command-line prompts.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>history redo</strong> ?<em>event</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Re-executes the command indicated by <em>event</em> and returns its
result. <em>Event</em> defaults to <strong>-1</strong>. This command
results in history revision: see below for details.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="history-revision">HISTORY REVISION</h1>
<p>Pre-8.0 Tcl had a complex history revision mechanism. The current
mechanism is more limited, and the old history operations
<strong>substitute</strong> and <strong>words</strong> have been
removed. (As a consolation, the <strong>clear</strong> operation was
added.)</p>
<p>The history option <strong>redo</strong> results in much simpler When
this option is invoked then the most recent event is modified to
eliminate the history command and replace it with the result of the
history command. If you want to redo an event without modifying history,
then use the <strong>event</strong> operation to retrieve some event,
and the <strong>add</strong> operation to add it to history and execute
it.</p>
