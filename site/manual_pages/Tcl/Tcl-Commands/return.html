<p><strong>return</strong> ?<em>result</em>?</p>
<p><strong>return</strong> ?<strong>-code</strong> <em>code</em>?
?<em>result</em>?</p>
<p><strong>return</strong> ?<em>option value</em> ...?
?<em>result</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In its simplest usage, the <strong>return</strong> command is used
without options in the body of a procedure to immediately return control
to the caller of the procedure. If a <em>result</em> argument is
provided, its value becomes the result of the procedure passed back to
the caller. If <em>result</em> is not specified then an empty string
will be returned to the caller as the result of the procedure.</p>
<p>The <strong>return</strong> command serves a similar function within
script files that are evaluated by the <strong>source</strong> command.
When <strong>source</strong> evaluates the contents of a file as a
script, an invocation of the <strong>return</strong> command will cause
script evaluation to immediately cease, and the value <em>result</em>
(or an empty string) will be returned as the result of the
<strong>source</strong> command.</p>
<h1 id="exceptional-return-codes">EXCEPTIONAL RETURN CODES</h1>
<p>In addition to the result of a procedure, the return code of a
procedure may also be set by <strong>return</strong> through use of the
<strong>-code</strong> option. In the usual case where the
<strong>-code</strong> option is not specified the procedure will return
normally. However, the <strong>-code</strong> option may be used to
generate an exceptional return from the procedure. <em>Code</em> may
have any of the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>ok</strong> (or <strong>0</strong>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Normal return: same as if the option is omitted. The return code of
the procedure is 0 (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>error</strong> (or <strong>1</strong>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Error return: the return code of the procedure is 1
(<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>). The procedure command behaves in its
calling context as if it were the command <strong>error</strong>
<em>result</em>. See below for additional options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>return</strong> (or <strong>2</strong>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The return code of the procedure is 2 (<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>).
The procedure command behaves in its calling context as if it were the
command <strong>return</strong> (with no arguments).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>break</strong> (or <strong>3</strong>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The return code of the procedure is 3 (<strong>TCL_BREAK</strong>).
The procedure command behaves in its calling context as if it were the
command <strong>break</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>continue</strong> (or <strong>4</strong>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The return code of the procedure is 4
(<strong>TCL_CONTINUE</strong>). The procedure command behaves in its
calling context as if it were the command <strong>continue</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>value</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Value</em> must be an integer; it will be returned as the return
code for the current procedure.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a procedure wants to signal that it has received invalid
arguments from its caller, it may use <strong>return -code
error</strong> with <em>result</em> set to a suitable error message.
Otherwise usage of the <strong>return -code</strong> option is mostly
limited to procedures that implement a new control structure.</p>
<p>The <strong>return -code</strong> command acts similarly within
script files that are evaluated by the <strong>source</strong> command.
During the evaluation of the contents of a file as a script by
<strong>source</strong>, an invocation of the <strong>return
-code</strong> <em>code</em> command will cause the return code of
<strong>source</strong> to be <em>code</em>.</p>
<h1 id="return-options">RETURN OPTIONS</h1>
<p>In addition to a result and a return code, evaluation of a command in
Tcl also produces a dictionary of return options. In general usage, all
<em>option value</em> pairs given as arguments to
<strong>return</strong> become entries in the return options dictionary,
and any values at all are acceptable except as noted below. The
<strong>catch</strong> command may be used to capture all of this
information — the return code, the result, and the return options
dictionary — that arise from evaluation of a script.</p>
<p>As documented above, the <strong>-code</strong> entry in the return
options dictionary receives special treatment by Tcl. There are other
return options also recognized and treated specially by Tcl. They
are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-errorcode</strong> <em>list</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-errorcode</strong> option receives special treatment
only when the value of the <strong>-code</strong> option is
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. Then the <em>list</em> value is meant to be
additional information about the error, presented as a Tcl list for
further processing by programs. If no <strong>-errorcode</strong> option
is provided to <strong>return</strong> when the <strong>-code
error</strong> option is provided, Tcl will set the value of the
<strong>-errorcode</strong> entry in the return options dictionary to
the default value of <strong>NONE</strong>. The
<strong>-errorcode</strong> return option will also be stored in the
global variable <strong>errorCode</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-errorinfo</strong> <em>info</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-errorinfo</strong> option receives special treatment
only when the value of the <strong>-code</strong> option is
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. Then <em>info</em> is the initial stack
trace, meant to provide to a human reader additional information about
the context in which the error occurred. The stack trace will also be
stored in the global variable <strong>errorInfo</strong>. If no
<strong>-errorinfo</strong> option is provided to
<strong>return</strong> when the <strong>-code error</strong> option is
provided, Tcl will provide its own initial stack trace value in the
entry for <strong>-errorinfo</strong>. Tcl's initial stack trace will
include only the call to the procedure, and stack unwinding will append
information about higher stack levels, but there will be no information
about the context of the error within the procedure. Typically the
<em>info</em> value is supplied from the value of
<strong>-errorinfo</strong> in a return options dictionary captured by
the <strong>catch</strong> command (or from the copy of that information
stored in the global variable <strong>errorInfo</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-errorstack</strong> <em>list</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>-errorstack</strong> option receives special treatment
only when the value of the <strong>-code</strong> option is
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. Then <em>list</em> is the initial error
stack, recording actual argument values passed to each proc level. The
error stack will also be reachable through <strong>info
errorstack</strong>. If no <strong>-errorstack</strong> option is
provided to <strong>return</strong> when the <strong>-code
error</strong> option is provided, Tcl will provide its own initial
error stack in the entry for <strong>-errorstack</strong>. Tcl's initial
error stack will include only the call to the procedure, and stack
unwinding will append information about higher stack levels, but there
will be no information about the context of the error within the
procedure. Typically the <em>list</em> value is supplied from the value
of <strong>-errorstack</strong> in a return options dictionary captured
by the <strong>catch</strong> command (or from the copy of that
information from <strong>info errorstack</strong>).</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-level</strong> <em>level</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-level</strong> and <strong>-code</strong> options work
together to set the return code to be returned by one of the commands
currently being evaluated. The <em>level</em> value must be a
non-negative integer representing a number of levels on the call stack.
It defines the number of levels up the stack at which the return code of
a command currently being evaluated should be <em>code</em>. If no
<strong>-level</strong> option is provided, the default value of
<em>level</em> is 1, so that <strong>return</strong> sets the return
code that the current procedure returns to its caller, 1 level up the
call stack. The mechanism by which these options work is described in
more detail below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-options</strong> <em>options</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The value <em>options</em> must be a valid dictionary. The entries of
that dictionary are treated as additional <em>option value</em> pairs
for the <strong>return</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="return-code-handling-mechanisms">RETURN CODE HANDLING
MECHANISMS</h1>
<p>Return codes are used in Tcl to control program flow. A Tcl script is
a sequence of Tcl commands. So long as each command evaluation returns a
return code of <strong>TCL_OK</strong>, evaluation will continue to the
next command in the script. Any exceptional return code
(non-<strong>TCL_OK</strong>) returned by a command evaluation causes
the flow on to the next command to be interrupted. Script evaluation
ceases, and the exceptional return code from the command becomes the
return code of the full script evaluation. This is the mechanism by
which errors during script evaluation cause an interruption and
unwinding of the call stack. It is also the mechanism by which commands
like <strong>break</strong>, <strong>continue</strong>, and
<strong>return</strong> cause script evaluation to terminate without
evaluating all commands in sequence.</p>
<p>Some of Tcl's built-in commands evaluate scripts as part of their
functioning. These commands can make use of exceptional return codes to
enable special features. For example, the built-in Tcl commands that
provide loops — such as <strong>while</strong>, <strong>for</strong>,
and <strong>foreach</strong> — evaluate a script that is the body of the
loop. If evaluation of the loop body returns the return code of
<strong>TCL_BREAK</strong> or <strong>TCL_CONTINUE</strong>, the loop
command can react in such a way as to give the <strong>break</strong>
and <strong>continue</strong> commands their documented interpretation
in loops.</p>
<p>Procedure invocation also involves evaluation of a script, the body
of the procedure. Procedure invocation provides special treatment when
evaluation of the procedure body returns the return code
<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>. In that circumstance, the
<strong>-level</strong> entry in the return options dictionary is
decremented. If after decrementing, the value of the
<strong>-level</strong> entry is 0, then the value of the
<strong>-code</strong> entry becomes the return code of the procedure.
If after decrementing, the value of the <strong>-level</strong> entry is
greater than zero, then the return code of the procedure is
<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>. If the procedure invocation occurred during
the evaluation of the body of another procedure, the process will repeat
itself up the call stack, decrementing the value of the
<strong>-level</strong> entry at each level, so that the <em>code</em>
will be the return code of the current command <em>level</em> levels up
the call stack. The <strong>source</strong> command performs the same
handling of the <strong>TCL_RETURN</strong> return code, which explains
the similarity of <strong>return</strong> invocation during a
<strong>source</strong> to <strong>return</strong> invocation within a
procedure.</p>
<p>The return code of the <strong>return</strong> command itself
triggers this special handling by procedure invocation. If
<strong>return</strong> is provided the option <strong>-level
0</strong>, then the return code of the <strong>return</strong> command
itself will be the value <em>code</em> of the <strong>-code</strong>
option (or <strong>TCL_OK</strong> by default). Any other value for the
<strong>-level</strong> option (including the default value of 1) will
cause the return code of the <strong>return</strong> command itself to
be <strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>, triggering a return from the enclosing
procedure.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>First, a simple example of using <strong>return</strong> to return
from a procedure, interrupting the procedure body.</p>
<pre><code>proc printOneLine {} {
    puts &quot;line 1&quot;    ;# This line will be printed.
    return
    puts &quot;line 2&quot;    ;# This line will not be printed.
}</code></pre>
<p>Next, an example of using <strong>return</strong> to set the value
returned by the procedure.</p>
<pre><code>proc returnX {} {return X}
puts [returnX]    ;# prints &quot;X&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, a more complete example, using <strong>return -code
error</strong> to report invalid arguments.</p>
<pre><code>proc factorial {n} {
    if {![string is integer $n] || ($n &lt; 0)} {
        return -code error \
                &quot;expected non-negative integer,\
                but got \&quot;$n\&quot;&quot;
    }
    if {$n &lt; 2} {
        return 1
    }
    set m [expr {$n - 1}]
    set code [catch {factorial $m} factor]
    if {$code != 0} {
        return -code $code $factor
    }
    set product [expr {$n * $factor}]
    if {$product &lt; 0} {
        return -code error \
                &quot;overflow computing factorial of $n&quot;
    }
    return $product
}</code></pre>
<p>Next, a procedure replacement for <strong>break</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>proc myBreak {} {
    return -code break
}</code></pre>
<p>With the <strong>-level 0</strong> option, <strong>return</strong>
itself can serve as a replacement for <strong>break</strong>, with the
help of <strong>interp alias</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>interp alias {} Break {} return -level 0 -code break</code></pre>
<p>An example of using <strong>catch</strong> and <strong>return
-options</strong> to re-raise a caught error:</p>
<pre><code>proc doSomething {} {
    set resource [allocate]
    catch {
        # Long script of operations
        # that might raise an error
    } result options
    deallocate $resource
    return -options $options $result
}</code></pre>
<p>Finally an example of advanced use of the <strong>return</strong>
options to create a procedure replacement for <strong>return</strong>
itself:</p>
<pre><code>proc myReturn {args} {
    set result &quot;&quot;
    if {[llength $args] % 2} {
        set result [lindex $args end]
        set args [lrange $args 0 end-1]
    }
    set options [dict merge {-level 1} $args]
    dict incr options -level
    return -options $options $result
}</code></pre>
