<p>exec - Invoke subprocesses</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>exec</strong> ?<em>switches</em>? <em>arg</em> ?<em>arg
...</em>? ?<strong>&amp;</strong>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command treats its arguments as the specification of one or more
subprocesses to execute. The arguments take the form of a standard shell
pipeline where each <em>arg</em> becomes one word of a command, and each
distinct command becomes a subprocess. The result of the command is the
standard output of the final subprocess in the pipeline, interpreted
using the system <strong>encoding</strong>; to use any other encoding
(especially including binary data), the pipeline must be
<strong>open</strong>ed, configured and read explicitly.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments to <strong>exec</strong> start with
<strong>-</strong> then they are treated as command-line switches and
are not part of the pipeline specification. The following switches are
currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-ignorestderr</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Stops the <strong>exec</strong> command from treating the output of
messages to the pipeline's standard error channel as an error case.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-keepnewline</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline's output. Normally a
trailing newline will be deleted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>- -</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
treated as the first <em>arg</em> even if it starts with a
<strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If an <em>arg</em> (or pair of <em>arg</em>s) has one of the forms
described below then it is used by <strong>exec</strong> to control the
flow of input and output among the subprocess(es). Such arguments will
not be passed to the subprocess(es). In forms such as <em>fileName</em>
may either be in a separate argument from or in the same argument with
no intervening space (i.e.</p>

which must have been opened for writing.</p>

<dt><strong>2&gt;@ </strong><em>fileId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>FileId</em> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the
return value from a previous call to <strong>open</strong>. Standard

<em>fileId</em>'s file. The file must have been opened for writing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>2&gt;<span class="citation"

<dd>
<p>Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the
command result. This operator is only valid at the end of the command
pipeline.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>&gt;&amp;@ </strong><em>fileId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>FileId</em> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the
return value from a previous call to <strong>open</strong>. Both
standard output from the last command and standard error from all
commands are redirected to <em>fileId</em>'s file. The file must have
been opened for writing.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If standard output has not been redirected then the
<strong>exec</strong> command returns the standard output from the last
command in the pipeline, unless was specified, in which case standard
error is included as well. If any of the commands in the pipeline exit
abnormally or are killed or suspended, then <strong>exec</strong> will
return an error and the error message will include the pipeline's output
followed by error messages describing the abnormal terminations; the
<strong>-errorcode</strong> return option will contain additional
information about the last abnormal termination encountered. If any of
the commands writes to its standard error file and that standard error
is not redirected and <strong>-ignorestderr</strong> is not specified,
then <strong>exec</strong> will return an error; the error message will
include the pipeline's standard output, followed by messages about
abnormal terminations (if any), followed by the standard error
output.</p>
<p>If the last character of the result or error message is a newline
then that character is normally deleted from the result or error
message. This is consistent with other Tcl return values, which do not
normally end with newlines. However, if <strong>-keepnewline</strong> is
specified then the trailing newline is retained.</p>
<p>If standard input is not redirected with or then the standard input
for the first command in the pipeline is taken from the application's
current standard input.</p>
<p>If the last <em>arg</em> is then the pipeline will be executed in
background. In this case the <strong>exec</strong> command will return a
list whose elements are the process identifiers for all of the
subprocesses in the pipeline. The standard output from the last command
in the pipeline will go to the application's standard output if it has
not been redirected, and error output from all of the commands in the
pipeline will go to the application's standard error file unless
redirected.</p>
<p>The first word in each command is taken as the command name;
tilde-substitution is performed on it, and if the result contains no
slashes then the directories in the PATH environment variable are
searched for an executable by the given name. If the name contains a
slash then it must refer to an executable reachable from the current
directory. No expansion or other shell-like substitutions are performed
on the arguments to commands.</p>
<h1 id="portability-issues">PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Windows</strong> (all versions)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Reading from or writing to a socket, using the notation, does not
work. When reading from a socket, a 16-bit DOS application will hang and
a 32-bit application will return immediately with end-of-file. When
either type of application writes to a socket, the information is
instead sent to the console, if one is present, or is discarded.</p>
<p>Note that the current escape resp. quoting of arguments for windows
works only with executables using CommandLineToArgv, CRT-library or
similar, as well as with the windows batch files (excepting the newline,
see below). Although it is the common escape algorithm, but, in fact,
the way how the executable parses the command-line (resp. splits it into
single arguments) is decisive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is currently no way to supply newline character
within an argument to the batch files (<strong>.cmd</strong> or
<strong>.bat</strong>) or to the command processor (<strong>cmd.exe
/c</strong>), because this causes truncation of command-line (also the
argument chain) on the first newline character. But it works properly
with an executable (using CommandLineToArgv, etc).</p>
<p>The Tk console text widget does not provide real standard IO
capabilities. Under Tk, when redirecting from standard input, all
applications will see an immediate end-of-file; information redirected
to standard output or standard error will be discarded.</p>
<p>Either forward or backward slashes are accepted as path separators
for arguments to Tcl commands. When executing an application, the path
name specified for the application may also contain forward or backward
slashes as path separators. Bear in mind, however, that most Windows
applications accept arguments with forward slashes only as option
delimiters and backslashes only in paths. Any arguments to an
application that specify a path name with forward slashes will not
automatically be converted to use the backslash character. If an
argument contains forward slashes as the path separator, it may or may
not be recognized as a path name, depending on the program.</p>
<p>Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer to a
network path. For example, a simple concatenation of the root directory
<strong>c:/</strong> with a subdirectory
<strong>/windows/system</strong> will yield
<strong>c://windows/system</strong> (two slashes together), which refers
to the mount point called <strong>system</strong> on the machine called
<strong>windows</strong> (and the <strong>c:/</strong> is ignored), and
is not equivalent to <strong>c:/windows/system</strong>, which describes
a directory on the current computer. The <strong>file join</strong>
command should be used to concatenate path components.</p>
<p>Note that there are two general types of Win32 console
applications:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>CLI — CommandLine Interface, simple stdio exchange.
<strong>netstat.exe</strong> for example.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>TUI — Textmode User Interface, any application that accesses the
console API for doing such things as cursor movement, setting text
color, detecting key presses and mouse movement, etc. An example would
be <strong>telnet.exe</strong> from Windows 2000. These types of
applications are not common in a windows environment, but do exist.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>exec</strong> will not work well with TUI applications when a
console is not present, as is done when launching applications under
wish. It is desirable to have console applications hidden and detached.
This is a designed-in limitation as <strong>exec</strong> wants to
communicate over pipes. The Expect extension addresses this issue when
communicating with a TUI application.</p>
<p>When attempting to execute an application, <strong>exec</strong>
first searches for the name as it was specified. Then, in order,
<strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.exe</strong>, <strong>.bat</strong> and
<strong>.cmd</strong> are appended to the end of the specified name and
it searches for the longer name. If a directory name was not specified
as part of the application name, the following directories are
automatically searched in order when attempting to locate the
application:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>The current directory.</p></li>
<li><p>The Windows 32-bit system directory.</p></li>
<li><p>The Windows home directory.</p></li>
<li><p>The directories listed in the path.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to execute shell built-in commands like <strong>dir</strong>
and <strong>copy</strong>, the caller must prepend the desired command
with because built-in commands are not implemented using
executables.</p>

<p>The <strong>exec</strong> command is fully functional and works as
described.</p>

<h1 id="unix-examples">UNIX EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <strong>exec</strong>
command on Unix. To execute a simple program and get its result:</p>
<pre><code>exec uname -a</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-non-zero-results">WORKING WITH NON-ZERO
RESULTS</h2>
<p>To execute a program that can return a non-zero result, you should
wrap the call to <strong>exec</strong> in <strong>catch</strong> and
check the contents of the <strong>-errorcode</strong> return option if
you have an error:</p>
<pre><code>set status 0
if {[catch {exec grep foo bar.txt} results options]} {
    set details [dict get $options -errorcode]
    if {[lindex $details 0] eq &quot;CHILDSTATUS&quot;} {
        set status [lindex $details 2]
    } else {
        # Some other error; regenerate it to let caller handle
        return -options $options -level 0 $results
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is more easily written using the <strong>try</strong> command,
as that makes it simpler to trap specific types of errors. This is done
using code like this:</p>
<pre><code>try {
    set results [exec grep foo bar.txt]
    set status 0
} trap CHILDSTATUS {results options} {
    set status [lindex [dict get $options -errorcode] 2]
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-quoted-arguments">WORKING WITH QUOTED
ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p>When translating a command from a Unix shell invocation, care should
be taken over the fact that single quote characters have no special
significance to Tcl. Thus:</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;{sum += $1} END {print sum}&#39; numbers.list</code></pre>
<p>would be translated into something like:</p>
<pre><code>exec awk {{sum += $1} END {print sum}} numbers.list</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-globbing">WORKING WITH GLOBBING</h2>
<p>If you are converting invocations involving shell globbing, you
should remember that Tcl does not handle globbing or expand things into
multiple arguments by default. Instead you should write things like
this:</p>
<pre><code>exec ls -l {*}[glob *.tcl]</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-user-supplied-shell-script-fragments">WORKING WITH
USER-SUPPLIED SHELL SCRIPT FRAGMENTS</h2>
<p>One useful technique can be to expose to users of a script the
ability to specify a fragment of shell script to execute that will have
some data passed in on standard input that was produced by the Tcl
program. This is a common technique for using the <em>lpr</em> program
for printing. By far the simplest way of doing this is to pass the
user's script to the user's shell for processing, as this avoids a lot
of complexity with parsing other languages.</p>
<pre><code>set lprScript [get from user...]
set postscriptData [generate somehow...]

exec $env(SHELL) -c $lprScript &lt;&lt; $postscriptData</code></pre>
<h1 id="windows-examples">WINDOWS EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <strong>exec</strong>
command on Windows. To start an instance of <em>notepad</em> editing a
file without waiting for the user to finish editing the file:</p>
<pre><code>exec notepad myfile.txt &amp;</code></pre>
<p>To print a text file using <em>notepad</em>:</p>
<pre><code>exec notepad /p myfile.txt</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-console-programs">WORKING WITH CONSOLE
PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>If a program calls other programs, such as is common with compilers,
then you may need to resort to batch files to hide the console windows
that sometimes pop up:</p>
<pre><code>exec cmp.bat somefile.c -o somefile</code></pre>
<p>With the file <em>cmp.bat</em> looking something like:</p>
<pre><code>@gcc %*</code></pre>
<p>or like another variant using single parameters:</p>
<pre><code>@gcc %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-command-built-ins">WORKING WITH COMMAND
BUILT-INS</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to be careful, as different programs may have the
same name and be in the path. It can then happen that typing a command
at the DOS prompt finds <em>a different program</em> than the same
command run via <strong>exec</strong>. This is because of the
(documented) differences in behaviour between <strong>exec</strong> and
DOS batch files.</p>
<p>When in doubt, use the command <strong>auto_execok</strong>: it will
return the complete path to the program as seen by the
<strong>exec</strong> command. This applies especially when you want to
run commands like <em>dir</em> from a Tcl script (if you just want to
list filenames, use the <strong>glob</strong> command.) To do that, use
this:</p>
<pre><code>exec {*}[auto_execok dir] *.tcl</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-native-filenames">WORKING WITH NATIVE
FILENAMES</h2>
<p>Many programs on Windows require filename arguments to be passed in
with backslashes as pathname separators. This is done with the help of
the <strong>file nativename</strong> command. For example, to make a
directory (on NTFS) encrypted so that only the current user can access
it requires use of the <em>CIPHER</em> command, like this:</p>
<pre><code>set secureDir &quot;~/Desktop/Secure Directory&quot;
file mkdir $secureDir
exec CIPHER /e /s:[file nativename $secureDir]</code></pre>
