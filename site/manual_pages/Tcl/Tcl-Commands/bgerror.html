<p>bgerror - Command invoked to process background errors</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>bgerror</strong> <em>message</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Release 8.5 of Tcl supports the <strong>interp bgerror</strong>
command, which allows applications to register in an interpreter the
command that will handle background errors in that interpreter. In older
releases of Tcl, this level of control was not available, and
applications could control the handling of background errors only by
creating a command with the particular command name
<strong>bgerror</strong> in the global namespace of an interpreter. The
following documentation describes the interface requirements of the
<strong>bgerror</strong> command an application might define to retain
compatibility with pre-8.5 releases of Tcl. Applications intending to
support only Tcl releases 8.5 and later should simply make use of
<strong>interp bgerror</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>bgerror</strong> command does not exist as built-in part
of Tcl. Instead, individual applications or users can define a
<strong>bgerror</strong> command (e.g. as a Tcl procedure) if they wish
to handle background errors.</p>
<p>A background error is one that occurs in an event handler or some
other command that did not originate with the application. For example,
if an error occurs while executing a command specified with the
<strong>after</strong> command, then it is a background error. For a
non-background error, the error can simply be returned up through nested
Tcl command evaluations until it reaches the top-level code in the
application; then the application can report the error in whatever way
it wishes. When a background error occurs, the unwinding ends in the Tcl
library and there is no obvious way for Tcl to report the error.</p>
<p>When Tcl detects a background error, it saves information about the
error and invokes a handler command registered by <strong>interp
bgerror</strong> later as an idle event handler. The default handler
command in turn calls the <strong>bgerror</strong> command . Before
invoking <strong>bgerror</strong>, Tcl restores the
<strong>errorInfo</strong> and <strong>errorCode</strong> variables to
their values at the time the error occurred, then it invokes
<strong>bgerror</strong> with the error message as its only argument.
Tcl assumes that the application has implemented the
<strong>bgerror</strong> command, and that the command will report the
error in a way that makes sense for the application. Tcl will ignore any
result returned by the <strong>bgerror</strong> command as long as no
error is generated.</p>
<p>If another Tcl error occurs within the <strong>bgerror</strong>
command (for example, because no <strong>bgerror</strong> command has
been defined) then Tcl reports the error itself by writing a message to
stderr.</p>
<p>If several background errors accumulate before
<strong>bgerror</strong> is invoked to process them,
<strong>bgerror</strong> will be invoked once for each error, in the
order they occurred. However, if <strong>bgerror</strong> returns with a
break exception, then any remaining errors are skipped without calling
<strong>bgerror</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are writing code that will be used by others as part of a
package or other kind of library, consider avoiding
<strong>bgerror</strong>. The reason for this is that the application
programmer may also want to define a <strong>bgerror</strong>, or use
other code that does and thus will have trouble integrating your
code.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This <strong>bgerror</strong> procedure appends errors to a file,
with a timestamp.</p>
<pre><code>proc bgerror {message} {
    set timestamp [clock format [clock seconds]]
    set fl [open mylog.txt {WRONLY CREAT APPEND}]
    puts $fl &quot;$timestamp: bgerror in $::argv &#39;$message&#39;&quot;
    close $fl
}</code></pre>
