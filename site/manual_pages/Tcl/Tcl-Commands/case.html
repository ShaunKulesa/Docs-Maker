<p><strong>case</strong> <em>string</em> ?<strong>in</strong>?

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Note: the</em> <strong>case</strong> <em>command is obsolete and
is supported only</em> for backward compatibility. At some point in the
future it may be removed entirely. You should use the
<strong>switch</strong> <em>command instead.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>case</strong> command matches <em>string</em> against
each of the <em>patList</em> arguments in order. Each <em>patList</em>
argument is a list of one or more patterns. If any of these patterns
matches <em>string</em> then <strong>case</strong> evaluates the
following <em>body</em> argument by passing it recursively to the Tcl
interpreter and returns the result of that evaluation. Each
<em>patList</em> argument consists of a single pattern or list of
patterns. Each pattern may contain any of the wild-cards described under
<strong>string match</strong>. If a <em>patList</em> argument is
<strong>default</strong>, the corresponding body will be evaluated if no
<em>patList</em> matches <em>string</em>. If no <em>patList</em>
argument matches <em>string</em> and no default is given, then the
<strong>case</strong> command returns an empty string.</p>
<p>Two syntaxes are provided for the <em>patList</em> and <em>body</em>
arguments. The first uses a separate argument for each of the patterns
and commands; this form is convenient if substitutions are desired on
some of the patterns or commands. The second form places all of the
patterns and commands together into a single argument; the argument must
have proper list structure, with the elements of the list being the
patterns and commands. The second form makes it easy to construct
multi-line case commands, since the braces around the whole list make it
unnecessary to include a backslash at the end of each line. Since the
<em>patList</em> arguments are in braces in the second form, no command
or variable substitutions are performed on them; this makes the behavior
of the second form different than the first form in some cases.</p>
