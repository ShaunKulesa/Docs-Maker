<p>array - Manipulate array variables</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>array</strong> <em>option arrayName</em> ?<em>arg arg
...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command performs one of several operations on the variable given
by <em>arrayName</em>. Unless otherwise specified for individual
commands below, <em>arrayName</em> must be the name of an existing array
variable. The <em>option</em> argument determines what action is carried
out by the command. The legal <em>options</em> (which may be
abbreviated) are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>array anymore</strong> <em>arrayName searchId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if there are any more elements left to be processed in an
array search, 0 if all elements have already been returned.
<em>SearchId</em> indicates which search on <em>arrayName</em> to check,
and must have been the return value from a previous invocation of
<strong>array startsearch</strong>. This option is particularly useful
if an array has an element with an empty name, since the return value
from <strong>array nextelement</strong> will not indicate whether the
search has been completed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array donesearch</strong> <em>arrayName searchId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command terminates an array search and destroys all the state
associated with that search. <em>SearchId</em> indicates which search on
<em>arrayName</em> to destroy, and must have been the return value from
a previous invocation of <strong>array startsearch</strong>. Returns an
empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array exists</strong> <em>arrayName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns 1 if <em>arrayName</em> is an array variable, 0 if there is
no variable by that name or if it is a scalar variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array get</strong> <em>arrayName</em>
?<em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing pairs of elements. The first element in
each pair is the name of an element in <em>arrayName</em> and the second
element of each pair is the value of the array element. The order of the
pairs is undefined. If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, then all of
the elements of the array are included in the result. If
<em>pattern</em> is specified, then only those elements whose names
match <em>pattern</em> (using the matching rules of <strong>string
match</strong>) are included. If <em>arrayName</em> is not the name of
an array variable, or if the array contains no elements, then an empty
list is returned. If traces on the array modify the list of elements,
the elements returned are those that exist both before and after the
call to <strong>array get</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array names</strong> <em>arrayName</em> ?<em>mode</em>?
?<em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing the names of all of the elements in the
array that match <em>pattern</em>. <em>Mode</em> may be one of
<strong>-exact</strong>, <strong>-glob</strong>, or
<strong>-regexp</strong>. If specified, <em>mode</em> designates which
matching rules to use to match <em>pattern</em> against the names of the
elements in the array. If not specified, <em>mode</em> defaults to
<strong>-glob</strong>. See the documentation for <strong>string
match</strong> for information on glob style matching, and the
documentation for <strong>regexp</strong> for information on regexp
matching. If <em>pattern</em> is omitted then the command returns all of
the element names in the array. If there are no (matching) elements in
the array, or if <em>arrayName</em> is not the name of an array
variable, then an empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array nextelement</strong> <em>arrayName searchId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the name of the next element in <em>arrayName</em>, or an
empty string if all elements of <em>arrayName</em> have already been
returned in this search. The <em>searchId</em> argument identifies the
search, and must have been the return value of an <strong>array
startsearch</strong> command. Warning: if elements are added to or
deleted from the array, then all searches are automatically terminated
just as if <strong>array donesearch</strong> had been invoked; this will
cause <strong>array nextelement</strong> operations to fail for those
searches.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array set</strong> <em>arrayName list</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the values of one or more elements in <em>arrayName</em>.
<em>list</em> must have a form like that returned by <strong>array
get</strong>, consisting of an even number of elements. Each
odd-numbered element in <em>list</em> is treated as an element name
within <em>arrayName</em>, and the following element in <em>list</em> is
used as a new value for that array element. If the variable
<em>arrayName</em> does not already exist and <em>list</em> is empty,
<em>arrayName</em> is created with an empty array value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array size</strong> <em>arrayName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string giving the number of elements in the array.
If <em>arrayName</em> is not the name of an array then 0 is
returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array startsearch</strong> <em>arrayName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command initializes an element-by-element search through the
array given by <em>arrayName</em>, such that invocations of the
<strong>array nextelement</strong> command will return the names of the
individual elements in the array. When the search has been completed,
the <strong>array donesearch</strong> command should be invoked. The
return value is a search identifier that must be used in <strong>array
nextelement</strong> and <strong>array donesearch</strong> commands; it
allows multiple searches to be underway simultaneously for the same
array. It is currently more efficient and easier to use either the
<strong>array</strong> get or <strong>array names</strong>, together
with <strong>foreach</strong>, to iterate over all but very large
arrays. See the examples below for how to do this.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array statistics</strong> <em>arrayName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns statistics about the distribution of data within the
hashtable that represents the array. This information includes the
number of entries in the table, the number of buckets, and the
utilization of the buckets.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>array unset</strong> <em>arrayName</em>
?<em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unsets all of the elements in the array that match <em>pattern</em>
(using the matching rules of <strong>string match</strong>). If
<em>arrayName</em> is not the name of an array variable or there are no
matching elements in the array, no error will be raised. If
<em>pattern</em> is omitted and <em>arrayName</em> is an array variable,
then the command unsets the entire array. The command always returns an
empty string.</p>
