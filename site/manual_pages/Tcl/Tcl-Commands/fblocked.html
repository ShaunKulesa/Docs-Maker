<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>fblocked - Test whether the last input operation exhausted all
available input</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>fblocked</strong> <em>channelId</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>fblocked</strong> command returns 1 if the most recent
input operation on <em>channelId</em> returned less information than
requested because all available input was exhausted. For example, if
<strong>gets</strong> is invoked when there are only three characters
available for input and no end-of-line sequence, <strong>gets</strong>
returns an empty string and a subsequent call to
<strong>fblocked</strong> will return 1.</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> must be an identifier for an open channel such as
a Tcl standard channel (<strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong>,
or <strong>stderr</strong>), the return value from an invocation of
<strong>open</strong> or <strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a
channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>The <strong>fblocked</strong> command is particularly useful when
writing network servers, as it allows you to write your code in a
line-by-line style without preventing the servicing of other
connections. This can be seen in this simple echo-service:</p>
<p># This is called whenever a new client connects to the server proc
connect {chan host port} { set clientName [format &lt;%s:%d&gt; $host
$port] puts "connection from $clientName" fconfigure $chan -blocking 0
-buffering line fileevent $chan readable [list echoLine $chan
$clientName] }</p>
<p># This is called whenever either at least one byte of input # data is
available, or the channel was closed by the client. proc echoLine {chan
clientName} { gets $chan line if {[eof $chan]} { puts "finishing
connection from $clientName" close $chan } elseif
{![<strong>fblocked</strong> $chan]} { # Didn't block waiting for
end-of-line puts "$clientName - $line" puts $chan $line } }</p>
<p># Create the server socket and enter the event-loop to wait # for
incoming connections... socket -server connect 12345 vwait forever</p>
