<p>catch - Evaluate script and trap exceptional returns</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>catch</strong> <em>script</em> ?<em>resultVarName</em>?
?<em>optionsVarName</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>catch</strong> command may be used to prevent errors from
aborting command interpretation. The <strong>catch</strong> command
calls the Tcl interpreter recursively to execute <em>script</em>, and
always returns without raising an error, regardless of any errors that
might occur while executing <em>script</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>script</em> raises an error, <strong>catch</strong> will
return a non-zero integer value corresponding to the exceptional return
code returned by evaluation of <em>script</em>. Tcl defines the normal
return code from script evaluation to be zero (0), or
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>. Tcl also defines four exceptional return codes:
1 (<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>), 2 (<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>), 3
(<strong>TCL_BREAK</strong>), and 4 (<strong>TCL_CONTINUE</strong>).
Errors during evaluation of a script are indicated by a return code of
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. The other exceptional return codes are
returned by the <strong>return</strong>, <strong>break</strong>, and
<strong>continue</strong> commands and in other special situations as
documented. Tcl packages can define new commands that return other
integer values as return codes as well, and scripts that make use of the
<strong>return -code</strong> command can also have return codes other
than the five defined by Tcl.</p>
<p>If the <em>resultVarName</em> argument is given, then the variable it
names is set to the result of the script evaluation. When the return
code from the script is 1 (<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>), the value stored
in <em>resultVarName</em> is an error message. When the return code from
the script is 0 (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>), the value stored in
<em>resultVarName</em> is the value returned from <em>script</em>.</p>
<p>If the <em>optionsVarName</em> argument is given, then the variable
it names is set to a dictionary of return options returned by evaluation
of <em>script</em>. Tcl specifies two entries that are always defined in
the dictionary: <strong>-code</strong> and <strong>-level</strong>. When
the return code from evaluation of <em>script</em> is not
<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>, the value of the <strong>-level</strong>
entry will be 0, and the value of the <strong>-code</strong> entry will
be the same as the return code. Only when the return code is
<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong> will the values of the
<strong>-level</strong> and <strong>-code</strong> entries be something
else, as further described in the documentation for the
<strong>return</strong> command.</p>
<p>When the return code from evaluation of <em>script</em> is
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>, four additional entries are defined in the
dictionary of return options stored in <em>optionsVarName</em>:
<strong>-errorinfo</strong>, <strong>-errorcode</strong>,
<strong>-errorline</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>-errorstack</strong>.</p>
<p>The value of the <strong>-errorinfo</strong> entry is a formatted
stack trace containing more information about the context in which the
error happened. The formatted stack trace is meant to be read by a
person. The value of the <strong>-errorcode</strong> entry is additional
information about the error stored as a list. The
<strong>-errorcode</strong> value is meant to be further processed by
programs, and may not be particularly readable by people. The value of
the <strong>-errorline</strong> entry is an integer indicating which
line of <em>script</em> was being evaluated when the error occurred.</p>
<p>The value of the <strong>-errorstack</strong> entry is an even-sized
list made of token-parameter pairs accumulated while unwinding the
stack. The token may be in which case the parameter is a list made of
the proc name and arguments at the corresponding level; or it may be in
which case the parameter is the relative level (as in
<strong>uplevel</strong>) of the previous <strong>CALL</strong>. The
salient differences with respect to <strong>-errorinfo</strong> are
that:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>it is a machine-readable form that is amenable to processing with
[<strong>foreach</strong> {tok prm} ...],</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>it contains the true (substituted) values passed to the functions,
instead of the static text of the calling sites, and</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>it is coarser-grained, with only one element per stack frame (like
procs; no separate elements for <strong>foreach</strong> constructs for
example).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The values of the <strong>-errorinfo</strong> and
<strong>-errorcode</strong> entries of the most recent error are also
available as values of the global variables <strong>::errorInfo</strong>
and <strong>::errorCode</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>The value of the <strong>-errorstack</strong> entry surfaces as
<strong>info errorstack</strong>.</p>
<p>Tcl packages may provide commands that set other entries in the
dictionary of return options, and the <strong>return</strong> command
may be used by scripts to set return options in addition to those
defined above.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The <strong>catch</strong> command may be used in an
<strong>if</strong> to branch based on the success of a script.</p>
<pre><code>if { [catch {open $someFile w} fid] } {
    puts stderr &quot;Could not open $someFile for writing\n$fid&quot;
    exit 1
}</code></pre>
<p>There are more complex examples of <strong>catch</strong> usage in
the documentation for the <strong>return</strong> command.</p>
