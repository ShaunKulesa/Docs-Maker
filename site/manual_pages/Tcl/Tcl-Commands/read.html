<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>read - Read from a channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>read</strong> ?<strong>-nonewline</strong>?
<em>channelId</em></p>
<p><strong>read</strong> <em>channelId numChars</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In the first form, the <strong>read</strong> command reads all of the
data from <em>channelId</em> up to the end of the file. If the
<strong>-nonewline</strong> switch is specified then the last character
of the file is discarded if it is a newline. In the second form, the
extra argument specifies how many characters to read. Exactly that many
characters will be read and returned, unless there are fewer than
<em>numChars</em> left in the file; in this case all the remaining
characters are returned. If the channel is configured to use a
multi-byte encoding, then the number of characters read may not be the
same as the number of bytes read.</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> must be an identifier for an open channel such as
the Tcl standard input channel (<strong>stdin</strong>), the return
value from an invocation of <strong>open</strong> or
<strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a channel creation command
provided by a Tcl extension. The channel must have been opened for
input.</p>
<p>If <em>channelId</em> is in nonblocking mode, the command may not
read as many characters as requested: once all available input has been
read, the command will return the data that is available rather than
blocking for more input. If the channel is configured to use a
multi-byte encoding, then there may actually be some bytes remaining in
the internal buffers that do not form a complete character. These bytes
will not be returned until a complete character is available or
end-of-file is reached. The <strong>-nonewline</strong> switch is
ignored if the command returns before reaching the end of the file.</p>
<p><strong>Read</strong> translates end-of-line sequences in the input
into newline characters according to the <strong>-translation</strong>
option for the channel. See the <strong>fconfigure</strong> manual entry
for a discussion on ways in which <strong>fconfigure</strong> will alter
input.</p>
<h1 id="use-with-serial-ports">USE WITH SERIAL PORTS</h1>
<p>For most applications a channel connected to a serial port should be
configured to be nonblocking: <strong>fconfigure</strong>
<em>channelId</em> <strong>-blocking</strong> <em>0</em>. Then
<strong>read</strong> behaves much like described above. Care must be
taken when using <strong>read</strong> on blocking serial ports:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>read</strong> <em>channelId numChars</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form <strong>read</strong> blocks until <em>numChars</em>
have been received from the serial port.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>read</strong> <em>channelId</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this form <strong>read</strong> blocks until the reception of the
end-of-file character, see <strong>fconfigure</strong>
<strong>-eofchar</strong>. If there no end-of-file character has been
configured for the channel, then <strong>read</strong> will block
forever.</p>
</dd>

<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This example code reads a file all at once, and splits it into a
list, with each line in the file corresponding to an element in the
list:</p>
<pre><code>set fl [open /proc/meminfo]
set data [read $fl]
close $fl
set lines [split $data \n]</code></pre>
