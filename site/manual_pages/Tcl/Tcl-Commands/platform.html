<p>platform - System identification support code and utilities</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>package require platform ?1.0.10?

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>platform</strong> package provides several utility
commands useful for the identification of the architecture of a machine
running Tcl.</p>
<p>Whilst Tcl provides the <strong>tcl_platform</strong> array for
identifying the current architecture (in particular, the platform and
machine elements) this is not always sufficient. This is because (on
Unix machines) <strong>tcl_platform</strong> reflects the values
returned by the <strong>uname</strong> command and these are not
standardized across platforms and architectures. In addition, on at
least one platform (AIX) the <strong>tcl_platform(machine)</strong>
contains the CPU serial number.</p>
<p>Consequently, individual applications need to manipulate the values
in <strong>tcl_platform</strong> (along with the output of system
specific utilities) - which is both inconvenient for developers, and
introduces the potential for inconsistencies in identifying
architectures and in naming conventions.</p>
<p>The <strong>platform</strong> package prevents such fragmentation -
i.e., it establishes a standard naming convention for architectures
running Tcl and makes it more convenient for developers to identify the
current architecture a Tcl program is running on.</p>
<h1 id="commands">COMMANDS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>platform::identify</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command returns an identifier describing the platform the Tcl
core is running on. The returned identifier has the general format
<em>OS</em>-<em>CPU</em>. The <em>OS</em> part of the identifier may
contain details like kernel version, libc version, etc., and this
information may contain dashes as well. The <em>CPU</em> part will not
contain dashes, making the preceding dash the last dash in the
result.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>platform::generic</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command returns a simplified identifier describing the platform
the Tcl core is running on. In contrast to
<strong>platform::identify</strong> it leaves out details like kernel
version, libc version, etc. The returned identifier has the general
format <em>OS</em>-<em>CPU</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>platform::patterns</strong> <em>identifier</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command takes an identifier as returned by
<strong>platform::identify</strong> and returns a list of identifiers
describing compatible architectures.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>This can be used to allow an application to be shipped with multiple
builds of a shared library, so that the same package works on many
versions of an operating system. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package require platform
# Assume that app script is .../theapp/bin/theapp.tcl
set binDir [file dirname [file normalize [info script]]]
set libDir [file join $binDir .. lib]
set platLibDir [file join $libDir [platform::identify]]
load [file join $platLibDir support[info sharedlibextension]]</code></pre>
