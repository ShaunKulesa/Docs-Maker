<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command loads binary code from a file into the application's
address space and calls an initialization procedure in the library to
incorporate it into an interpreter. <em>fileName</em> is the name of the
file containing the code; its exact form varies from system to system
but on most systems it is a shared library, such as a
<strong>.so</strong> file under Solaris or a DLL under Windows.
<em>prefix</em> is used to compute the name of an initialization
procedure. <em>interp</em> is the path name of the interpreter into
which to load the library (see the <strong>interp</strong> manual entry
for details); if <em>interp</em> is omitted, it defaults to the
interpreter in which the <strong>load</strong> command was invoked.</p>
<p>Once the file has been loaded into the application's address space,
one of two initialization procedures will be invoked in the new code.
Typically the initialization procedure will add new commands to a Tcl
interpreter. The name of the initialization procedure is determined by
<em>prefix</em> and whether or not the target interpreter is a safe one.
For normal interpreters the name of the initialization procedure will
have the form <em>pfx</em><strong>_Init</strong>, where <em>pfx</em> is
the same as <em>prefix</em> except that the first letter is converted to
upper case and all other letters are converted to lower case. For
example, if <em>prefix</em> is <strong>foo</strong> or
<strong>FOo</strong>, the initialization procedure's name will be
<strong>Foo_Init</strong>.</p>
<p>If the target interpreter is a safe interpreter, then the name of the
initialization procedure will be <em>pfx</em><strong>_SafeInit</strong>
instead of <em>pfx</em><strong>_Init</strong>. The
<em>pfx</em><strong>_SafeInit</strong> function should be written
carefully, so that it initializes the safe interpreter only with partial
functionality provided by the library that is safe for use by untrusted
code. For more information on Safe-Tcl, see the <strong>safe</strong>
manual entry.</p>
<p>The initialization procedure must match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument identifies the interpreter in which the
library is to be loaded. The initialization procedure must return
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> to indicate
whether or not it completed successfully; in the event of an error it
should set the interpreter's result to point to an error message. The
result of the <strong>load</strong> command will be the result returned
by the initialization procedure.</p>
<p>The actual loading of a file will only be done once for each
<em>fileName</em> in an application. If a given <em>fileName</em> is
loaded into multiple interpreters, then the first <strong>load</strong>
will load the code and call the initialization procedure; subsequent
<strong>load</strong>s will call the initialization procedure without
loading the code again. For Tcl versions lower than 8.5, it is not
possible to unload or reload a library. From version 8.5 however, the
<strong>unload</strong> command allows the unloading of libraries loaded
with <strong>load</strong>, for libraries that are aware of the Tcl's
unloading mechanism.</p>
<p>The <strong>load</strong> command also supports libraries that are
statically linked with the application, if those libraries have been
registered by calling the <strong>Tcl_StaticPackage</strong> procedure.
If <em>fileName</em> is an empty string, then <em>prefix</em> must be
specified.</p>
<p>If <em>prefix</em> is omitted or specified as an empty string, Tcl
tries to guess the prefix. This may be done differently on different
platforms. The default guess, which is used on most UNIX platforms, is
to take the last element of <em>fileName</em>, strip off the first three
characters if they are <strong>lib</strong>, and use any following
alphabetic and underline characters, converted to titlecase as the
prefix. For example, the command <strong>load libxyz4.2.so</strong> uses
the prefix <strong>Xyz</strong> and the command <strong>load bin/last.so
{}</strong> uses the prefix <strong>Last</strong>.</p>
<p>If <em>fileName</em> is an empty string, then <em>prefix</em> must be
specified. The <strong>load</strong> command first searches for a
statically loaded library (one that has been registered by calling the
<strong>Tcl_StaticPackage</strong> procedure) by that name; if one is
found, it is used. Otherwise, the <strong>load</strong> command searches
for a dynamically loaded library by that name, and uses it if it is
found. If several different files have been <strong>load</strong>ed with
different versions of the library, Tcl picks the file that was loaded
first.</p>
<p>If <strong>-global</strong> is specified preceding the filename, all
symbols found in the shared library are exported for global use by other
libraries. The option <strong>-lazy</strong> delays the actual loading
of symbols until their first actual use. The options may be abbreviated.
The option <strong>--</strong> indicates the end of the options, and
should be used if you wish to use a filename which starts with
<strong>-</strong> and you provide a prefix to the <strong>load</strong>
command.</p>
<p>On platforms which do not support the <strong>-global</strong> or
<strong>-lazy</strong> options, the options still exist but have no
effect. Note that use of the <strong>-global</strong> or
<strong>-lazy</strong> option may lead to crashes in your application
later (in case of symbol conflicts resp. missing symbols), which cannot
be detected during the <strong>load</strong>. So, only use this when you
know what you are doing, you will not get a nice error message when
something is wrong with the loaded library.</p>

<p>When a load fails with error, it is also possible that a dependent
library was not found. To see the dependent libraries, type in a DOS
console to see what the library must import. When loading a DLL in the
current directory, Windows will ignore as a path specifier and use a
search heuristic to find the DLL instead. To avoid this, load the DLL
with:</p>
<pre><code>load [file join [pwd] mylib.DLL]</code></pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>If the same file is <strong>load</strong>ed by different
<em>fileName</em>s, it will be loaded into the process's address space
multiple times. The behavior of this varies from system to system (some
systems may detect the redundant loads, others may not).</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>The following is a minimal extension:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
static int fooCmd(void *clientData,
        Tcl_Interp *interp, int objc, Tcl_Obj *const objv[]) {
    printf(&quot;called with %d arguments\n&quot;, objc);
    return TCL_OK;
}
int Foo_Init(Tcl_Interp *interp) {
    if (Tcl_InitStubs(interp, &quot;8.1&quot;, 0) == NULL) {
    return TCL_ERROR;
    }
    printf(&quot;creating foo command&quot;);
    Tcl_CreateObjCommand(interp, &quot;foo&quot;, fooCmd, NULL, NULL);
    return TCL_OK;
}</code></pre>
<p>When built into a shared/dynamic library with a suitable name (e.g.
<strong>foo.dll</strong> on Windows, <strong>libfoo.so</strong> on
Solaris and Linux) it can then be loaded into Tcl with the
following:</p>
<pre><code># Load the extension
switch $tcl_platform(platform) {
    windows {
        load [file join [pwd] foo.dll]
    }
    unix {
        load [file join [pwd] libfoo[info sharedlibextension]]
    }
}

# Now execute the command defined by the extension
foo</code></pre>
