<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>throw - Generate a machine-readable error</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>throw</strong> <em>type message</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command causes the current evaluation to be unwound with an
error. The error created is described by the <em>type</em> and
<em>message</em> arguments: <em>type</em> must contain a list of words
describing the error in a form that is machine-readable (and which will
form the error-code part of the result dictionary), and <em>message</em>
should contain text that is intended for display to a human being.</p>
<p>The stack will be unwound until the error is trapped by a suitable
<strong>catch</strong> or <strong>try</strong> command. If it reaches
the event loop without being trapped, it will be reported through the
<strong>bgerror</strong> mechanism. If it reaches the top level of
script evaluation in <strong>tclsh</strong>, it will be printed on the
console before, in the non-interactive case, causing an exit (the
behavior in other programs will depend on the details of how Tcl is
embedded and used).</p>
<p>By convention, the words in the <em>type</em> argument should go from
most general to most specific.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The following produces an error that is identical to that produced by
<strong>expr</strong> when trying to divide a value by zero.</p>
<pre><code>throw {ARITH DIVZERO {divide by zero}} {divide by zero}</code></pre>
