<p>regsub - Perform substitutions based on regular expression pattern
matching</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>regsub</strong> ?<em>switches</em>? <em>exp string
subSpec</em> ?<em>varName</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command matches the regular expression <em>exp</em> against
<em>string</em>, and either copies <em>string</em> to the variable whose
name is given by <em>varName</em> or returns <em>string</em> if
<em>varName</em> is not present. (Regular expression matching is
described in the <strong>re_syntax</strong> reference page.) If there is
a match, then while copying <em>string</em> to <em>varName</em> (or to
the result of this command if <em>varName</em> is not present) the
portion of <em>string</em> that matched <em>exp</em> is replaced with
<em>subSpec</em>. If <em>subSpec</em> contains a or then it is replaced
in the substitution with the portion of <em>string</em> that matched
<em>exp</em>. If <em>subSpec</em> contains a where <em>n</em> is a digit
between 1 and 9, then it is replaced in the substitution with the
portion of <em>string</em> that matched the <em>n</em>'th parenthesized
subexpression of <em>exp</em>. Additional backslashes may be used in
<em>subSpec</em> to prevent special interpretation of and backslashes.
The use of backslashes in <em>subSpec</em> tends to interact badly with
the Tcl parser's use of backslashes, so it is generally safest to
enclose <em>subSpec</em> in braces if it includes backslashes.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments to <strong>regsub</strong> start with
<strong>-</strong> then they are treated as switches. The following
switches are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-all</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>All ranges in <em>string</em> that match <em>exp</em> are found and
substitution is performed for each of these ranges. Without this switch
only the first matching range is found and substituted. If
<strong>-all</strong> is specified, then and sequences are handled for
each substitution using the information from the corresponding
match.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-expanded</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables use of the expanded regular expression syntax where
whitespace and comments are ignored. This is the same as specifying the
<strong>(?x)</strong> embedded option (see the
<strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-line</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables newline-sensitive matching. By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning. With this flag,
bracket expressions and never match newline, matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and matches an
empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function. This
flag is equivalent to specifying both <strong>-linestop</strong> and
<strong>-lineanchor</strong>, or the <strong>(?n)</strong> embedded
option (see the <strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-linestop</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes the behavior of bracket expressions and so that they stop at
newlines. This is the same as specifying the <strong>(?p)</strong>
embedded option (see the <strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-lineanchor</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes the behavior of and (the so they match the beginning and end
of a line respectively. This is the same as specifying the
<strong>(?w)</strong> embedded option (see the
<strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-nocase</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Upper-case characters in <em>string</em> will be converted to
lower-case before matching against <em>exp</em>; however, substitutions
specified by <em>subSpec</em> use the original unconverted form of
<em>string</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-start</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a character index offset into the string to start matching
the regular expression at. The <em>index</em> value is interpreted in
the same manner as the <em>index</em> argument to <strong>string
index</strong>. When using this switch, will not match the beginning of
the line, and \A will still match the start of the string at
<em>index</em>. <em>index</em> will be constrained to the bounds of the
input string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-â€†-</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
treated as <em>exp</em> even if it starts with a <strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <em>varName</em> is supplied, the command returns a count of the
number of matching ranges that were found and replaced, otherwise the
string after replacement is returned. See the manual entry for
<strong>regexp</strong> for details on the interpretation of regular
expressions.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Replace (in the string in variable <em>string</em>) every instance of
<strong>foo</strong> which is a word by itself with
<strong>bar</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>regsub -all {\mfoo\M} $string bar string</code></pre>
<p>or (using the syntax):</p>
<pre><code>regsub -all {(?b)\&lt;foo\&gt;} $string bar string</code></pre>
<p>Insert double-quotes around the first instance of the word
<strong>interesting</strong>, however it is capitalized.</p>
<pre><code>regsub -nocase {\yinteresting\y} $string {&quot;&amp;&quot;} string</code></pre>
<p>Convert all non-ASCII and Tcl-significant characters into \u escape
sequences by using <strong>regsub</strong> and <strong>subst</strong> in
combination:</p>
<pre><code># This RE is just a character class for almost everything &quot;bad&quot;
set RE {[][{};#\\\$ \r\t\u0080-\uffff]}

# We will substitute with a fragment of Tcl script in brackets
set substitution {[format \\\\u%04x [scan &quot;\\&amp;&quot; %c]]}

# Now we apply the substitution to get a subst-string that
# will perform the computational parts of the conversion. Note
# that newline is handled specially through string map since
# backslash-newline is a special sequence.
set quoted [subst [string map {\n {\\u000a}} \
        [regsub -all $RE $string $substitution]]]</code></pre>
