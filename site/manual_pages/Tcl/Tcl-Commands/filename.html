<p>filename - File name conventions supported by Tcl commands</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>All Tcl commands and C procedures that take file names as arguments
expect the file names to be in one of three forms, depending on the
current platform. On each platform, Tcl supports file names in the
standard forms(s) for that platform. In addition, on all platforms, Tcl
supports a Unix-like syntax intended to provide a convenient way of
constructing simple file names. However, scripts that are intended to be
portable should not assume a particular form for file names. Instead,
portable scripts must use the <strong>file split</strong> and
<strong>file</strong> join commands to manipulate file names (see the
<strong>file</strong> manual entry for more details).</p>
<h1 id="path-types">PATH TYPES</h1>
<p>File names are grouped into three general types based on the starting
point for the path used to specify the file: absolute, relative, and
volume-relative. Absolute names are completely qualified, giving a path
to the file relative to a particular volume and the root directory on
that volume. Relative names are unqualified, giving a path to the file
relative to the current working directory. Volume-relative names are
partially qualified, either giving the path relative to the root
directory on the current volume, or relative to the current directory of
the specified volume. The <strong>file pathtype</strong> command can be
used to determine the type of a given path.</p>
<h1 id="path-syntax">PATH SYNTAX</h1>
<p>The rules for native names depend on the value reported in the Tcl
<strong>platform</strong> element of the <strong>tcl_platform</strong>
array:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Unix</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>On Unix and Apple MacOS X platforms, Tcl uses path names where the
components are separated by slashes. Path names may be relative or
absolute, and file names may contain any character other than slash. The
file names <strong>.</strong> and <strong>..</strong> are special and
refer to the current directory and the parent of the current directory
respectively. Multiple adjacent slash characters are interpreted as a
single separator. Any number of trailing slash characters at the end of
a path are simply ignored, so the paths <strong>foo</strong>,
<strong>foo/</strong> and <strong>foo//</strong> are all identical, and
in particular <strong>foo/</strong> does not necessarily mean a
directory is being referred.</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate various forms of path names:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>/</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Absolute path to the root directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>/etc/passwd</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Absolute path to the file named <strong>passwd</strong> in the
directory <strong>etc</strong> in the root directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>.</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Relative path to the current directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>foo</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Relative path to the file <strong>foo</strong> in the current
directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>foo/bar</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Relative path to the file <strong>bar</strong> in the directory
<strong>foo</strong> in the current directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>../foo</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Relative path to the file <strong>foo</strong> in the directory above
the current directory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Windows</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>On Microsoft Windows platforms, Tcl supports both drive-relative and
UNC style names. Both <strong>/</strong> and <strong>\</strong> may be
used as directory separators in either type of name. Drive-relative
names consist of an optional drive specifier followed by an absolute or
relative path. UNC paths follow the general form
<strong>\\servername\sharename\path\file</strong>, but must at the very
least contain the server and share components, i.e.
<strong>\\servername\sharename</strong>. In both forms, the file names
<strong>.</strong> and <strong>..</strong> are special and refer to the
current directory and the parent of the current directory respectively.
The following examples illustrate various forms of path names:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>\\Host\share/file</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Absolute UNC path to a file called <strong>file</strong> in the root
directory of the export point <strong>share</strong> on the host
<strong>Host</strong>. Note that repeated use of <strong>file
dirname</strong> on this path will give <strong>//Host/share</strong>,
and will never give just <strong>//Host</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>c:foo</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Volume-relative path to a file <strong>foo</strong> in the current
directory on drive <strong>c</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>c:/foo</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Absolute path to a file <strong>foo</strong> in the root directory of
drive <strong>c</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>foo\bar</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Relative path to a file <strong>bar</strong> in the
<strong>foo</strong> directory in the current directory on the current
volume.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>\foo</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Volume-relative path to a file <strong>foo</strong> in the root
directory of the current volume.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>\\foo</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Volume-relative path to a file <strong>foo</strong> in the root
directory of the current volume. This is not a valid UNC path, so the
assumption is that the extra backslashes are superfluous.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="tilde-substitution">TILDE SUBSTITUTION</h1>
<p>In addition to the file name rules described above, Tcl also supports
<em>csh</em>-style tilde substitution. If a file name starts with a
tilde, then the file name will be interpreted as if the first element is
replaced with the location of the home directory for the given user. If
the tilde is followed immediately by a separator, then the
<strong>$HOME</strong> environment variable is substituted. Otherwise
the characters between the tilde and the next separator are taken as a
user name, which is used to retrieve the user's home directory for
substitution. This works on Unix, MacOS X and Windows (except very old
releases).</p>
<p>Old Windows platforms do not support tilde substitution when a user
name follows the tilde. On these platforms, attempts to use a tilde
followed by a user name will generate an error that the user does not
exist when Tcl attempts to interpret that part of the path or otherwise
access the file. The behaviour of these paths when not trying to
interpret them is the same as on Unix. File names that have a tilde
without a user name will be correctly substituted using the
<strong>$HOME</strong> environment variable, just like for Unix.</p>
<h1 id="portability-issues">PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<p>Not all file systems are case sensitive, so scripts should avoid code
that depends on the case of characters in a file name. In addition, the
character sets allowed on different devices may differ, so scripts
should choose file names that do not contain special characters like:
<strong>&lt;&gt;:?"/\|</strong>. The safest approach is to use names
consisting of alphanumeric characters only. Care should be taken with
filenames which contain spaces (common on Windows systems) and filenames
where the backslash is the directory separator (Windows native path
names).</p>
<p>On Windows platforms there are file and path length restrictions.
Complete paths or filenames longer than about 260 characters will lead
to errors in most file operations.</p>
<p>Another Windows peculiarity is that any number of trailing dots in
filenames are totally ignored, so, for example, attempts to create a
file or directory with a name will result in the creation of a
file/directory with name This fact is reflected in the results of
<strong>file normalize</strong>. Furthermore, a file name consisting
only of dots or dots with trailing characters is illegal.</p>
