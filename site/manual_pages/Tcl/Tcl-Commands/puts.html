<p>puts - Write to a channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>puts</strong> ?<strong>-nonewline</strong>?
?<em>channelId</em>? <em>string</em></p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Writes the characters given by <em>string</em> to the channel given
by <em>channelId</em>.</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> must be an identifier for an open channel such as
a Tcl standard channel (<strong>stdout</strong> or
<strong>stderr</strong>), the return value from an invocation of
<strong>open</strong> or <strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a
channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The channel must
have been opened for output.</p>
<p>If no <em>channelId</em> is specified then it defaults to
<strong>stdout</strong>. <strong>Puts</strong> normally outputs a
newline character after <em>string</em>, but this feature may be
suppressed by specifying the <strong>-nonewline</strong> switch.</p>
<p>Newline characters in the output are translated by
<strong>puts</strong> to platform-specific end-of-line sequences
according to the current value of the <strong>-translation</strong>
option for the channel (for example, on PCs newlines are normally
replaced with carriage-return-linefeed sequences. See the
<strong>fconfigure</strong> manual entry for a discussion on ways in
which <strong>fconfigure</strong> will alter output.</p>
<p>Tcl buffers output internally, so characters written with
<strong>puts</strong> may not appear immediately on the output file or
device; Tcl will normally delay output until the buffer is full or the
channel is closed. You can force output to appear immediately with the
<strong>flush</strong> command.</p>
<p>When the output buffer fills up, the <strong>puts</strong> command
will normally block until all the buffered data has been accepted for
output by the operating system. If <em>channelId</em> is in nonblocking
mode then the <strong>puts</strong> command will not block even if the
operating system cannot accept the data. Instead, Tcl continues to
buffer the data and writes it in the background as fast as the
underlying file or device can accept it. The application must use the
Tcl event loop for nonblocking output to work; otherwise Tcl never finds
out that the file or device is ready for more output data. It is
possible for an arbitrarily large amount of data to be buffered for a
channel in nonblocking mode, which could consume a large amount of
memory. To avoid wasting memory, nonblocking I/O should normally be used
in an event-driven fashion with the <strong>fileevent</strong> command
(do not invoke <strong>puts</strong> unless you have recently been
notified via a file event that the channel is ready for more output
data).</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Write a short message to the console (or wherever
<strong>stdout</strong> is directed):</p>
<pre><code>puts &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Print a message in several parts:</p>
<pre><code>puts -nonewline &quot;Hello, &quot;
puts &quot;World!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Print a message to the standard error channel:</p>
<pre><code>puts stderr &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Append a log message to a file:</p>
<pre><code>set chan [open my.log a]
set timestamp [clock format [clock seconds]]
puts $chan &quot;$timestamp - Hello, World!&quot;
close $chan</code></pre>
