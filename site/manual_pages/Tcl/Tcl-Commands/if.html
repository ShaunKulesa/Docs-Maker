<p>if - Execute scripts conditionally</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>if</strong> <em>expr1</em> ?<strong>then</strong>?
<em>body1</em> <strong>elseif</strong> <em>expr2</em>
?<strong>then</strong>? <em>body2</em> <strong>elseif</strong> ...
?<strong>else</strong>? ?<em>bodyN</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>if</em> command evaluates <em>expr1</em> as an expression (in
the same way that <strong>expr</strong> evaluates its argument). The
value of the expression must be a boolean (a numeric value, where 0 is
false and anything is true, or a string value such as
<strong>true</strong> or <strong>yes</strong> for true and
<strong>false</strong> or <strong>no</strong> for false); if it is true
then <em>body1</em> is executed by passing it to the Tcl interpreter.
Otherwise <em>expr2</em> is evaluated as an expression and if it is true
then <strong>body2</strong> is executed, and so on. If none of the
expressions evaluates to true then <em>bodyN</em> is executed. The
<strong>then</strong> and <strong>else</strong> arguments are optional
to make the command easier to read. There may be any number of
<strong>elseif</strong> clauses, including zero. <em>BodyN</em> may also
be omitted as long as <strong>else</strong> is omitted too. The return
value from the command is the result of the body script that was
executed, or an empty string if none of the expressions was non-zero and
there was no <em>bodyN</em>.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>A simple conditional:</p>
<pre><code>if {$vbl == 1} { puts &quot;vbl is one&quot; }</code></pre>
<p>With an <strong>else</strong>-clause:</p>
<pre><code>if {$vbl == 1} {
    puts &quot;vbl is one&quot;
} else {
    puts &quot;vbl is not one&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>With an <strong>elseif</strong>-clause too:</p>
<pre><code>if {$vbl == 1} {
    puts &quot;vbl is one&quot;
} elseif {$vbl == 2} {
    puts &quot;vbl is two&quot;
} else {
    puts &quot;vbl is not one or two&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>Remember, expressions can be multi-line, but in that case it can be a
good idea to use the optional <strong>then</strong> keyword for
clarity:</p>
<pre><code>if {
    $vbl == 1
    || $vbl == 2
    || $vbl == 3
} then {
    puts &quot;vbl is one, two or three&quot;
}</code></pre>
