<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>my - invoke any method of current object</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>package require TclOO

my methodName ?arg ...?</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>my</strong> command is used to allow methods of objects
to invoke any method of the object (or its class). In particular, the
set of valid values for <em>methodName</em> is the set of all methods
supported by an object and its superclasses, including those that are
not exported. The object upon which the method is invoked is always the
one that is the current context of the method (i.e. the object that is
returned by <strong>self object</strong>) from which the
<strong>my</strong> command is invoked.</p>
<p>Each object has its own <strong>my</strong> command, contained in its
instance namespace.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example shows basic use of <strong>my</strong> to use the
<strong>variables</strong> method of the <strong>oo::object</strong>
class, which is not publicly visible by default:</p>
<pre><code>oo::class create c {
    method count {} {
        my variable counter
        puts [incr counter]
    }
}
c create o
o count              → prints &quot;1&quot;
o count              → prints &quot;2&quot;
o count              → prints &quot;3&quot;</code></pre>
