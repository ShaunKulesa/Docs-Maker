<p>scan - Parse string using conversion specifiers in the style of
sscanf</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>scan</strong> <em>string format</em> ?<em>varName varName
...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>This command parses substrings from an input string in a fashion
similar to the ANSI C <strong>sscanf</strong> procedure and returns a
count of the number of conversions performed, or -1 if the end of the
input string is reached before any conversions have been performed.
<em>String</em> gives the input to be parsed and <em>format</em>
indicates how to parse it, using <strong>%</strong> conversion
specifiers as in <strong>sscanf</strong>. Each <em>varName</em> gives
the name of a variable; when a substring is scanned from <em>string</em>
that matches a conversion specifier, the substring is assigned to the
corresponding variable. If no <em>varName</em> variables are specified,
then <strong>scan</strong> works in an inline manner, returning the data
that would otherwise be stored in the variables as a list. In the inline
case, an empty string is returned when the end of the input string is
reached before any conversions have been performed.</p>
<h1 id="details-on-scanning">DETAILS ON SCANNING</h1>
<p><strong>Scan</strong> operates by scanning <em>string</em> and
<em>format</em> together. If the next character in <em>format</em> is a
blank or tab then it matches any number of white space characters in
<em>string</em> (including zero). Otherwise, if it is not a
<strong>%</strong> character then it must match the next character of
<em>string</em>. When a <strong>%</strong> is encountered in
<em>format</em>, it indicates the start of a conversion specifier. A
conversion specifier contains up to four fields after the
<strong>%</strong>: a XPG3 position specifier (or a <strong>*</strong>
to indicate the converted value is to be discarded instead of assigned
to any variable); a number indicating a maximum substring width; a size
modifier; and a conversion character. All of these fields are optional
except for the conversion character. The fields that are present must
appear in the order given above.</p>
<p>When <strong>scan</strong> finds a conversion specifier in
<em>format</em>, it first skips any white-space characters in
<em>string</em> (unless the conversion character is <strong>[</strong>
or <strong>c</strong>). Then it converts the next input characters
according to the conversion specifier and stores the result in the
variable given by the next argument to <strong>scan</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="optional-positional-specifier">OPTIONAL POSITIONAL
SPECIFIER</h2>
<p>If the <strong>%</strong> is followed by a decimal number and a
<strong>$</strong>, as in then the variable to use is not taken from the
next sequential argument. Instead, it is taken from the argument
indicated by the number, where 1 corresponds to the first
<em>varName</em>. If there are any positional specifiers in
<em>format</em> then all of the specifiers must be positional. Every
<em>varName</em> on the argument list must correspond to exactly one
conversion specifier or an error is generated, or in the inline case,
any position can be specified at most once and the empty positions will
be filled in with empty strings.</p>
<h2 id="optional-size-modifier">OPTIONAL SIZE MODIFIER</h2>
<p>The size modifier field is used only when scanning a substring into
one of Tcl's integer values. The size modifier field dictates the
integer range acceptable to be stored in a variable, or, for the inline
case, in a position in the result list. The syntactically valid values
for the size modifier are <strong>h</strong>, <strong>L</strong>,
<strong>l</strong>, and <strong>ll</strong>. The <strong>h</strong> size
modifier value is equivalent to the absence of a size modifier in the
the conversion specifier. Either one indicates the integer range to be
stored is limited to the same range produced by the
<strong>int()</strong> function of the <strong>expr</strong> command.
The <strong>L</strong> size modifier is equivalent to the
<strong>l</strong> size modifier. Either one indicates the integer range
to be stored is limited to the same range produced by the
<strong>wide()</strong> function of the <strong>expr</strong> command.
The <strong>ll</strong> size modifier indicates that the integer range
to be stored is unlimited.</p>
<h2 id="mandatory-conversion-character">MANDATORY CONVERSION
CHARACTER</h2>
<p>The following conversion characters are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>d</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring must be a decimal integer. It is read in and the
integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as required by the
size modifier value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>o</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring must be an octal integer. It is read in and the
integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as required by the
size modifier value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>x</strong> or <strong>X</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring must be a hexadecimal integer. It is read in and
the integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as required by
the size modifier value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>b</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring must be a binary integer. It is read in and the
integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as required by the
size modifier value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>u</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring must be a decimal integer. The integer value is
truncated as required by the size modifier value, and the corresponding
unsigned value for that truncated range is computed and stored in the
variable as a decimal string. The conversion makes no sense without
reference to a truncation range, so the size modifier
<strong>ll</strong> is not permitted in combination with conversion
character <strong>u</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>i</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring must be an integer. The base (i.e. decimal,
octal, or hexadecimal) is determined by the C convention (leading 0 for
octal; prefix 0x for hexadecimal). The integer value is stored in the
variable, truncated as required by the size modifier value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>c</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A single character is read in and its Unicode value is stored in the
variable as an integer value. Initial white space is not skipped in this
case, so the input substring may be a white-space character.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>s</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring consists of all the characters up to the next
white-space character; the characters are copied to the variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>e</strong> or <strong>f</strong> or <strong>g</strong> or
<strong>E</strong> or <strong>G</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring must be a floating-point number consisting of an
optional sign, a string of decimal digits possibly containing a decimal
point, and an optional exponent consisting of an <strong>e</strong> or
<strong>E</strong> followed by an optional sign and a string of decimal
digits. It is read in and stored in the variable as a floating-point
value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>[</strong><em>chars</em><strong>]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring consists of one or more characters in
<em>chars</em>. The matching string is stored in the variable. If the
first character between the brackets is a <strong>]</strong> then it is
treated as part of <em>chars</em> rather than the closing bracket for
the set. If <em>chars</em> contains a sequence of the form
<em>a</em><strong>-</strong><em>b</em> then any character between
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (inclusive) will match. If the first or last
character between the brackets is a <strong>-</strong>, then it is
treated as part of <em>chars</em> rather than indicating a range.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>[^</strong><em>chars</em><strong>]</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The input substring consists of one or more characters not in
<em>chars</em>. The matching string is stored in the variable. If the
character immediately following the <strong>^</strong> is a
<strong>]</strong> then it is treated as part of the set rather than the
closing bracket for the set. If <em>chars</em> contains a sequence of
the form <em>a</em><strong>-</strong><em>b</em> then any character
between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (inclusive) will be excluded from the
set. If the first or last character between the brackets is a
<strong>-</strong>, then it is treated as part of <em>chars</em> rather
than indicating a range value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>n</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>No input is consumed from the input string. Instead, the total number
of characters scanned from the input string so far is stored in the
variable.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The number of characters read from the input for a conversion is the
largest number that makes sense for that particular conversion (e.g. as
many decimal digits as possible for <strong>%d</strong>, as many octal
digits as possible for <strong>%o</strong>, and so on). The input
substring for a given conversion terminates either when a white-space
character is encountered or when the maximum substring width has been
reached, whichever comes first. If a <strong>*</strong> is present in
the conversion specifier then no variable is assigned and the next scan
argument is not consumed.</p>
<h1 id="differences-from-ansi-sscanf">DIFFERENCES FROM ANSI SSCANF</h1>
<p>The behavior of the <strong>scan</strong> command is the same as the
behavior of the ANSI C <strong>sscanf</strong> procedure except for the
following differences:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>%p</strong> conversion specifier is not supported.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>For <strong>%c</strong> conversions a single character value is
converted to a decimal string, which is then assigned to the
corresponding <em>varName</em>; no substring width may be specified for
this conversion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>h</strong> modifier is always ignored and the
<strong>l</strong> and <strong>L</strong> modifiers are ignored when
converting real values (i.e. type <strong>double</strong> is used for
the internal representation). The <strong>ll</strong> modifier has no
<strong>sscanf</strong> counterpart.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the end of the input string is reached before any conversions have
been performed and no variables are given, an empty string is
returned.</p>
</dd>

<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Convert a UNICODE character to its numeric value:</p>
<pre><code>set char &quot;x&quot;
set value [scan $char %c]</code></pre>
<p>Parse a simple color specification of the form <em>#RRGGBB</em> using
hexadecimal conversions with substring sizes:</p>
<pre><code>set string &quot;#08D03F&quot;
scan $string &quot;#%2x%2x%2x&quot; r g b</code></pre>
<p>Parse a <em>HH:MM</em> time string, noting that this avoids problems
with octal numbers by forcing interpretation as decimals (if we did not
care, we would use the <strong>%i</strong> conversion instead):</p>
<pre><code>set string &quot;08:08&quot;   ;# *Not* octal!
if {[scan $string &quot;%d:%d&quot; hours minutes] != 2} {
    error &quot;not a valid time string&quot;
}
# We have to understand numeric ranges ourselves...
if {$minutes &lt; 0 || $minutes &gt; 59} {
    error &quot;invalid number of minutes&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>Break a string up into sequences of non-whitespace characters (note
the use of the <strong>%n</strong> conversion so that we get skipping
over leading whitespace correct):</p>
<pre><code>set string &quot; a string {with braced words} + leading space &quot;
set words {}
while {[scan $string %s%n word length] == 2} {
    lappend words $word
    set string [string range $string $length end]
}</code></pre>
<p>Parse a simple coordinate string, checking that it is complete by
looking for the terminating character explicitly:</p>
<pre><code>set string &quot;(5.2,-4e-2)&quot;
# Note that the spaces before the literal parts of
# the scan pattern are significant, and that &quot;)&quot; is
# the Unicode character \u0029
if {
    [scan $string &quot; (%f ,%f %c&quot; x y last] != 3
    || $last != 0x0029
} then {
    error &quot;invalid coordinate string&quot;
}
puts &quot;X=$x, Y=$y&quot;</code></pre>
