<p>encoding - Manipulate encodings</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>encoding</strong> <em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Strings in Tcl are logically a sequence of 16-bit Unicode characters.
These strings are represented in memory as a sequence of bytes that may
be in one of several encodings: modified UTF-8 (which uses 1 to 3 bytes
per character), 16-bit (which uses 2 bytes per character, with an
endianness that is dependent on the host architecture), and binary
(which uses a single byte per character but only handles a restricted
range of characters). Tcl does not guarantee to always use the same
encoding for the same string.</p>
<p>Different operating system interfaces or applications may generate
strings in other encodings such as Shift-JIS. The
<strong>encoding</strong> command helps to bridge the gap between
Unicode and these other formats.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Performs one of several encoding related operations, depending on
<em>option</em>. The legal <em>option</em>s are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>encoding convertfrom</strong> ?<em>encoding</em>?
<em>data</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Convert <em>data</em> to Unicode from the specified
<em>encoding</em>. The characters in <em>data</em> are treated as binary
data where the lower 8-bits of each character is taken as a single byte.
The resulting sequence of bytes is treated as a string in the specified
<em>encoding</em>. If <em>encoding</em> is not specified, the current
system encoding is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>encoding convertto</strong> ?<em>encoding</em>?
<em>string</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Convert <em>string</em> from Unicode to the specified
<em>encoding</em>. The result is a sequence of bytes that represents the
converted string. Each byte is stored in the lower 8-bits of a Unicode
character (indeed, the resulting string is a binary string as far as Tcl
is concerned, at least initially). If <em>encoding</em> is not
specified, the current system encoding is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>encoding dirs</strong> ?<em>directoryList</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tcl can load encoding data files from the file system that describe
additional encodings for it to work with. This command sets the search
path for <strong>*.enc</strong> encoding data files to the list of
directories <em>directoryList</em>. If <em>directoryList</em> is omitted
then the command returns the current list of directories that make up
the search path. It is an error for <em>directoryList</em> to not be a
valid list. If, when a search for an encoding data file is happening, an
element in <em>directoryList</em> does not refer to a readable,
searchable directory, that element is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>encoding names</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing the names of all of the encodings that are
currently available. The encodings and are guaranteed to be present in
the list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>encoding system</strong> ?<em>encoding</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the system encoding to <em>encoding</em>. If <em>encoding</em> is
omitted then the command returns the current system encoding. The system
encoding is used whenever Tcl passes strings to system calls.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>The following example converts a byte sequence in Japanese euc-jp
encoding to a TCL string:</p>
<pre><code>set s [encoding convertfrom euc-jp &quot;\xA4\xCF&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>The result is the unicode codepoint: which is the Hiragana letter
HA.</p>
