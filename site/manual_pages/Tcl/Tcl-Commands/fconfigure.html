<p>fconfigure - Set and get options on a channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>fconfigure channelId
fconfigure channelId name
fconfigure channelId name value ?name value ...?</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>fconfigure</strong> command sets and retrieves options
for channels.</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> identifies the channel for which to set or query
an option and must refer to an open channel such as a Tcl standard
channel (<strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong>, or
<strong>stderr</strong>), the return value from an invocation of
<strong>open</strong> or <strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a
channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.</p>
<p>If no <em>name</em> or <em>value</em> arguments are supplied, the
command returns a list containing alternating option names and values
for the channel. If <em>name</em> is supplied but no <em>value</em> then
the command returns the current value of the given option. If one or
more pairs of <em>name</em> and <em>value</em> are supplied, the command
sets each of the named options to the corresponding <em>value</em>; in
this case the return value is an empty string.</p>
<p>The options described below are supported for all channels. In
addition, each channel type may add options that only it supports. See
the manual entry for the command that creates each type of channels for
the options that that specific type of channel supports. For example,
see the manual entry for the <strong>socket</strong> command for
additional options for sockets, and the <strong>open</strong> command
for additional options for serial devices.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-blocking</strong> <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-blocking</strong> option determines whether I/O
operations on the channel can cause the process to block indefinitely.
The value of the option must be a proper boolean value. Channels are
normally in blocking mode; if a channel is placed into nonblocking mode
it will affect the operation of the <strong>gets</strong>,
<strong>read</strong>, <strong>puts</strong>, <strong>flush</strong>,
and <strong>close</strong> commands by allowing them to operate
asynchronously; see the documentation for those commands for details.
For nonblocking mode to work correctly, the application must be using
the Tcl event loop (e.g. by calling <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or
invoking the <strong>vwait</strong> command).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-buffering</strong> <em>newValue</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>newValue</em> is <strong>full</strong> then the I/O system
will buffer output until its internal buffer is full or until the
<strong>flush</strong> command is invoked. If <em>newValue</em> is
<strong>line</strong>, then the I/O system will automatically flush
output for the channel whenever a newline character is output. If
<em>newValue</em> is <strong>none</strong>, the I/O system will flush
automatically after every output operation. The default is for
<strong>-buffering</strong> to be set to <strong>full</strong> except
for channels that connect to terminal-like devices; for these channels
the initial setting is <strong>line</strong>. Additionally,
<strong>stdin</strong> and <strong>stdout</strong> are initially set to
<strong>line</strong>, and <strong>stderr</strong> is set to
<strong>none</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-buffersize</strong> <em>newSize</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Newvalue</em> must be an integer; its value is used to set the
size of buffers, in bytes, subsequently allocated for this channel to
store input or output. <em>Newvalue</em> must be between one and one
million, allowing buffers of one to one million bytes in size.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-encoding</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used to specify the encoding of the channel, so that
the data can be converted to and from Unicode for use in Tcl. For
instance, in order for Tcl to read characters from a Japanese file in
<strong>shiftjis</strong> and properly process and display the contents,
the encoding would be set to <strong>shiftjis</strong>. Thereafter, when
reading from the channel, the bytes in the Japanese file would be
converted to Unicode as they are read. Writing is also supported - as
Tcl strings are written to the channel they will automatically be
converted to the specified encoding on output.</p>
<p>If a file contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG image), the
encoding for the channel should be configured to be
<strong>binary</strong>. Tcl will then assign no interpretation to the
data in the file and simply read or write raw bytes. The Tcl
<strong>binary</strong> command can be used to manipulate this
byte-oriented data. It is usually better to set the
<strong>-translation</strong> option to <strong>binary</strong> when you
want to transfer binary data, as this turns off the other automatic
interpretations of the bytes in the stream as well.</p>
<p>The default encoding for newly opened channels is the same platform-
and locale-dependent system encoding used for interfacing with the
operating system, as returned by <strong>encoding system</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-eofchar</strong> <em>char</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>-eofchar</strong> <strong>{</strong><em>inChar
outChar</em><strong>}</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option supports DOS file systems that use Control-z (\x1A) as an
end of file marker. If <em>char</em> is not an empty string, then this
character signals end-of-file when it is encountered during input. For
output, the end-of-file character is output when the channel is closed.
If <em>char</em> is the empty string, then there is no special end of
file character marker. For read-write channels, a two-element list
specifies the end of file marker for input and output, respectively. As
a convenience, when setting the end-of-file character for a read-write
channel you can specify a single value that will apply to both reading
and writing. When querying the end-of-file character of a read-write
channel, a two-element list will always be returned. The default value
for <strong>-eofchar</strong> is the empty string in all cases except
for files under Windows. In that case the <strong>-eofchar</strong> is
Control-z (\x1A) for reading and the empty string for writing. The
acceptable range for <strong>-eofchar</strong> values is \x01 - \x7F;
attempting to set <strong>-eofchar</strong> to a value outside of this
range will generate an error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-translation</strong> <em>mode</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>-translation</strong> <strong>{</strong><em>inMode
outMode</em><strong>}</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In Tcl scripts the end of a line is always represented using a single
newline character (\n). However, in actual files and devices the end of
a line may be represented differently on different platforms, or even
for different devices on the same platform. For example, under UNIX
newlines are used in files, whereas carriage-return-linefeed sequences
are normally used in network connections. On input (i.e., with
<strong>gets</strong> and <strong>read</strong>) the Tcl I/O system
automatically translates the external end-of-line representation into
newline characters. Upon output (i.e., with <strong>puts</strong>), the
I/O system translates newlines to the external end-of-line
representation. The default translation mode, <strong>auto</strong>,
handles all the common cases automatically, but the
<strong>-translation</strong> option provides explicit control over the
end of line translations.</p>
<p>The value associated with <strong>-translation</strong> is a single
item for read-only and write-only channels. The value is a two-element
list for read-write channels; the read translation mode is the first
element of the list, and the write translation mode is the second
element. As a convenience, when setting the translation mode for a
read-write channel you can specify a single value that will apply to
both reading and writing. When querying the translation mode of a
read-write channel, a two-element list will always be returned. The
following values are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>auto</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>As the input translation mode, <strong>auto</strong> treats any of
newline (<strong>lf</strong>), carriage return (<strong>cr</strong>), or
carriage return followed by a newline (<strong>crlf</strong>) as the end
of line representation. The end of line representation can even change
from line-to-line, and all cases are translated to a newline. As the
output translation mode, <strong>auto</strong> chooses a platform
specific representation; for sockets on all platforms Tcl chooses
<strong>crlf</strong>, for all Unix flavors, it chooses
<strong>lf</strong>, and for the various flavors of Windows it chooses
<strong>crlf</strong>. The default setting for
<strong>-translation</strong> is <strong>auto</strong> for both input
and output.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>binary</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>No end-of-line translations are performed. This is nearly identical
to <strong>lf</strong> mode, except that in addition
<strong>binary</strong> mode also sets the end-of-file character to the
empty string (which disables it) and sets the encoding to
<strong>binary</strong> (which disables encoding filtering). See the
description of <strong>-eofchar</strong> and <strong>-encoding</strong>
for more information.</p>
<p>Internally, i.e. when it comes to the actual behaviour of the
translator this value <strong>is</strong> identical to
<strong>lf</strong> and is therefore reported as such when queried. Even
if <strong>binary</strong> was used to set the translation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>cr</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is represented by
a single carriage return character. As the input translation mode,
<strong>cr</strong> mode converts carriage returns to newline
characters. As the output translation mode, <strong>cr</strong> mode
translates newline characters to carriage returns.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>crlf</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is represented by
a carriage return character followed by a linefeed character. As the
input translation mode, <strong>crlf</strong> mode converts
carriage-return-linefeed sequences to newline characters. As the output
translation mode, <strong>crlf</strong> mode translates newline
characters to carriage-return-linefeed sequences. This mode is typically
used on Windows platforms and for network connections.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>lf</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is represented by
a single newline (linefeed) character. In this mode no translations
occur during either input or output. This mode is typically used on UNIX
platforms.</p>
</dd>

<h1 id="standard-channels">STANDARD CHANNELS</h1>
<p>The Tcl standard channels (<strong>stdin</strong>,
<strong>stdout</strong>, and <strong>stderr</strong>) can be configured
through this command like every other channel opened by the Tcl library.
Beyond the standard options described above they will also support any
special option according to their current type. If, for example, a Tcl
application is started by the <strong>inet</strong> super-server common
on Unix system its Tcl standard channels will be sockets and thus
support the socket options.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Instruct Tcl to always send output to <strong>stdout</strong>
immediately, whether or not it is to a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>fconfigure stdout -buffering none</code></pre>
<p>Open a socket and read lines from it without ever blocking the
processing of other events:</p>
<pre><code>set s [socket some.where.com 12345]
fconfigure $s -blocking 0
fileevent $s readable &quot;readMe $s&quot;
proc readMe chan {
    if {[gets $chan line] &lt; 0} {
        if {[eof $chan]} {
            close $chan
            return
        }
        # Could not read a complete line this time; Tcl&#39;s
        # internal buffering will hold the partial line for us
        # until some more data is available over the socket.
    } else {
        puts stdout $line
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Read a PPM-format image from a file:</p>
<pre><code># Open the file and put it into Unix ASCII mode
set f [open teapot.ppm]
fconfigure $f -encoding ascii -translation lf

# Get the header
if {[gets $f] ne &quot;P6&quot;} {
    error &quot;not a raw-bits PPM&quot;
}

# Read lines until we have got non-comment lines
# that supply us with three decimal values.
set words {}
while {[llength $words] &lt; 3} {
    gets $f line
    if {[string match &quot;#*&quot; $line]} continue
    lappend words {*}[join [scan $line %d%d%d]]
}

# Those words supply the size of the image and its
# overall depth per channel. Assign to variables.
lassign $words xSize ySize depth

# Now switch to binary mode to pull in the data,
# one byte per channel (red,green,blue) per pixel.
fconfigure $f -translation binary
set numDataBytes [expr {3 * $xSize * $ySize}]
set data [read $f $numDataBytes]

close $f</code></pre>
