<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>timerate</strong> command does calibrated performance
measurement of a Tcl command or script, <em>script</em>. The
<em>script</em> should be written so that it can be executed multiple
times during the performance measurement process. Time is measured in
elapsed time using the finest timer resolution as possible, not CPU
time; if <em>script</em> interacts with the OS, the cost of that
interaction is included. This command may be used to provide information
as to how well a script or Tcl command is performing, and can help
determine bottlenecks and fine-tune application performance.</p>
<p>The first and second form will evaluate <em>script</em> until the
interval <em>time</em> given in milliseconds elapses, or for 1000
milliseconds (1 second) if <em>time</em> is not specified.</p>
<p>The parameter <em>max-count</em> could additionally impose a further
restriction by the maximal number of iterations to evaluate the script.
If <em>max-count</em> is specified, the evalution will stop either this
count of iterations is reached or the time is exceeded.</p>
<p>It will then return a canonical tcl-list of the form:</p>
<pre><code>0.095977 Âµs/# 52095836 # 10419167 #/sec 5000.000 net-ms</code></pre>
<p>which indicates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the average amount of time required per iteration, in
microseconds ([<strong>lindex</strong> $result 0])</p></li>
<li><p>the count how many times it was executed
([<strong>lindex</strong> $result 2])</p></li>
<li><p>the estimated rate per second ([<strong>lindex</strong> $result
4])</p></li>
<li><p>the estimated real execution time without measurement overhead
([<strong>lindex</strong> $result 6])</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following options may be supplied to the
<strong>timerate</strong> command:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-calibrate</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>To measure very fast scripts as exactly as possible, a calibration
process may be required. The <strong>-calibrate</strong> option is used
to calibrate <strong>timerate</strong> itself, calculating the estimated
overhead of the given script as the default overhead for future
invocations of the <strong>timerate</strong> command. If the
<em>time</em> parameter is not specified, the calibrate procedure runs
for up to 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Note that calibration is not thread safe in the current
implementation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-overhead</strong> <em>double</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-overhead</strong> parameter supplies an estimate (in
microseconds) of the measurement overhead of each iteration of the
tested script. This quantity will be subtracted from the measured time
prior to reporting results. This can be useful for removing the cost of
interpreter state reset commands from the script being measured.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-direct</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>-direct</strong> option causes direct execution of the
supplied script, without compilation, in a manner similar to the
<strong>time</strong> command. It can be used to measure the cost of
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>, of the invocation of canonical lists,
and of the uncompiled versions of bytecoded commands.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As opposed to the <strong>time</strong> commmand, which runs the
tested script for a fixed number of iterations, the timerate command
runs it for a fixed time. Additionally, the compiled variant of the
script will be used during the entire measurement, as if the script were
part of a compiled procedure, if the <strong>-direct</strong> option is
not specified. The fixed time period and possibility of compilation
allow for more precise results and prevent very long execution times by
slow scripts, making it practical for measuring scripts with highly
uncertain execution times.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Estimate how fast it takes for a simple Tcl <strong>for</strong> loop
(including operations on variable <em>i</em>) to count to ten:</p>
<pre><code># calibrate
timerate -calibrate {}

# measure
timerate { for {set i 0} {$i&lt;10} {incr i} {} } 5000</code></pre>
<p>Estimate how fast it takes for a simple Tcl <strong>for</strong>
loop, ignoring the overhead of the management of the variable that
controls the loop:</p>
<pre><code># calibrate for overhead of variable operations
set i 0; timerate -calibrate {expr {$i&lt;10}; incr i} 1000

# measure
timerate {
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;10} {incr i} {}
} 5000</code></pre>
<p>Estimate the speed of calculating the hour of the day using
<strong>clock format</strong> only, ignoring overhead of the portion of
the script that prepares the time for it to calculate:</p>
<pre><code># calibrate
timerate -calibrate {}

# estimate overhead
set tm 0
set ovh [lindex [timerate {
    incr tm [expr {24*60*60}]
}] 0]

# measure using estimated overhead
set tm 0
timerate -overhead $ovh {
    clock format $tm -format %H
    incr tm [expr {24*60*60}]; # overhead for this is ignored
} 5000</code></pre>
