<p>unknown - Handle attempts to use non-existent commands</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>unknown</strong> <em>cmdName</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command is invoked by the Tcl interpreter whenever a script
tries to invoke a command that does not exist. The default
implementation of <strong>unknown</strong> is a library procedure
defined when Tcl initializes an interpreter. You can override the
default <strong>unknown</strong> to change its functionality, or you can
register a new handler for individual namespaces using the
<strong>namespace unknown</strong> command. Note that there is no
default implementation of <strong>unknown</strong> in a safe
interpreter.</p>
<p>If the Tcl interpreter encounters a command name for which there is
not a defined command (in either the current namespace, or the global
namespace), then Tcl checks for the existence of an unknown handler for
the current namespace. By default, this handler is a command named
<strong>::unknown</strong>. If there is no such command, then the
interpreter returns an error. If the <strong>unknown</strong> command
exists (or a new handler has been registered for the current namespace),
then it is invoked with arguments consisting of the fully-substituted
name and arguments for the original non-existent command. The
<strong>unknown</strong> command typically does things like searching
through library directories for a command procedure with the name
<em>cmdName</em>, or expanding abbreviated command names to full-length,
or automatically executing unknown commands as sub-processes. In some
cases (such as expanding abbreviations) <strong>unknown</strong> will
change the original command slightly and then (re-)execute it. The
result of the <strong>unknown</strong> command is used as the result for
the original non-existent command.</p>
<p>The default implementation of <strong>unknown</strong> behaves as
follows. It first calls the <strong>auto_load</strong> library procedure
to load the command. If this succeeds, then it executes the original
command with its original arguments. If the auto-load fails then
<strong>unknown</strong> calls <strong>auto_execok</strong> to see if
there is an executable file by the name <em>cmd</em>. If so, it invokes
the Tcl <strong>exec</strong> command with <em>cmd</em> and all the
<em>args</em> as arguments. If <em>cmd</em> cannot be auto-executed,
<strong>unknown</strong> checks to see if the command was invoked at
top-level and outside of any script. If so, then
<strong>unknown</strong> takes two additional steps. First, it sees if
<em>cmd</em> has one of the following three forms: <strong>!!</strong>,
<strong>!</strong><em>event</em>, or
<strong>^</strong><em>old</em><strong>^</strong><em>new</em>?<strong>^</strong>?.
If so, then <strong>unknown</strong> carries out history substitution in
the same way that <strong>csh</strong> would for these constructs.
Finally, <strong>unknown</strong> checks to see if <em>cmd</em> is a
unique abbreviation for an existing Tcl command. If so, it expands the
command name and executes the command with the original arguments. If
none of the above efforts has been able to execute the command,
<strong>unknown</strong> generates an error return. If the global
variable <strong>auto_noload</strong> is defined, then the auto-load
step is skipped. If the global variable <strong>auto_noexec</strong> is
defined then the auto-exec step is skipped. Under normal circumstances
the return value from <strong>unknown</strong> is the return value from
the command that was eventually executed.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>Arrange for the <strong>unknown</strong> command to have its standard
behavior except for first logging the fact that a command was not
found:</p>
<pre><code># Save the original one so we can chain to it
rename unknown _original_unknown

# Provide our own implementation
proc unknown args {
    puts stderr &quot;WARNING: unknown command: $args&quot;
    uplevel 1 [list _original_unknown {*}$args]
}</code></pre>
