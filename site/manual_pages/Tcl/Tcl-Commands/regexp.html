<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>regexp - Match a regular expression against a string</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>regexp</strong> ?<em>switches</em>? <em>exp string</em>
?<em>matchVar</em>? ?<em>subMatchVar subMatchVar ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Determines whether the regular expression <em>exp</em> matches part
or all of <em>string</em> and returns 1 if it does, 0 if it does not,
unless <strong>-inline</strong> is specified (see below). (Regular
expression matching is described in the <strong>re_syntax</strong>
reference page.)</p>
<p>If additional arguments are specified after <em>string</em> then they
are treated as the names of variables in which to return information
about which part(s) of <em>string</em> matched <em>exp</em>.
<em>MatchVar</em> will be set to the range of <em>string</em> that
matched all of <em>exp</em>. The first <em>subMatchVar</em> will contain
the characters in <em>string</em> that matched the leftmost
parenthesized subexpression within <em>exp</em>, the next
<em>subMatchVar</em> will contain the characters that matched the next
parenthesized subexpression to the right in <em>exp</em>, and so on.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments to <strong>regexp</strong> start with
<strong>-</strong> then they are treated as switches. The following
switches are currently supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-about</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Instead of attempting to match the regular expression, returns a list
containing information about the regular expression. The first element
of the list is a subexpression count. The second element is a list of
property names that describe various attributes of the regular
expression. This switch is primarily intended for debugging
purposes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-expanded</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables use of the expanded regular expression syntax where
whitespace and comments are ignored. This is the same as specifying the
<strong>(?x)</strong> embedded option (see the
<strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-indices</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes what is stored in the <em>matchVar</em> and
<em>subMatchVar</em>s. Instead of storing the matching characters from
<em>string</em>, each variable will contain a list of two decimal
strings giving the indices in <em>string</em> of the first and last
characters in the matching range of characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-line</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables newline-sensitive matching. By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning. With this flag,
bracket expressions and never match newline, matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and matches an
empty string before any newline in addition to its normal function. This
flag is equivalent to specifying both <strong>-linestop</strong> and
<strong>-lineanchor</strong>, or the <strong>(?n)</strong> embedded
option (see the <strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-linestop</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes the behavior of bracket expressions and so that they stop at
newlines. This is the same as specifying the <strong>(?p)</strong>
embedded option (see the <strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-lineanchor</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes the behavior of and (the so they match the beginning and end
of a line respectively. This is the same as specifying the
<strong>(?w)</strong> embedded option (see the
<strong>re_syntax</strong> manual page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-nocase</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes upper-case characters in <em>string</em> to be treated as
lower case during the matching process.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-all</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes the regular expression to be matched as many times as possible
in the string, returning the total number of matches found. If this is
specified with match variables, they will contain information for the
last match only.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-inline</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes the command to return, as a list, the data that would
otherwise be placed in match variables. When using
<strong>-inline</strong>, match variables may not be specified. If used
with <strong>-all</strong>, the list will be concatenated at each
iteration, such that a flat list is always returned. For each match
iteration, the command will append the overall match data, plus one
element for each subexpression in the regular expression. Examples
are:</p>
<pre><code>regexp -inline -- {\w(\w)} &quot; inlined &quot;
      → in n
regexp -all -inline -- {\w(\w)} &quot; inlined &quot;
      → in n li i ne e</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-start</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a character index offset into the string to start matching
the regular expression at. The <em>index</em> value is interpreted in
the same manner as the <em>index</em> argument to <strong>string
index</strong>. When using this switch, will not match the beginning of
the line, and \A will still match the start of the string at
<em>index</em>. If <strong>-indices</strong> is specified, the indices
will be indexed starting from the absolute beginning of the input
string. <em>index</em> will be constrained to the bounds of the input
string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>- -</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
treated as <em>exp</em> even if it starts with a <strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If there are more <em>subMatchVar</em>s than parenthesized
subexpressions within <em>exp</em>, or if a particular subexpression in
<em>exp</em> does not match the string (e.g. because it was in a portion
of the expression that was not matched), then the corresponding
<em>subMatchVar</em> will be set to if <strong>-indices</strong> has
been specified or to an empty string otherwise.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Find the first occurrence of a word starting with
<strong>foo</strong> in a string that is not actually an instance of
<strong>foobar</strong>, and get the letters following it up to the end
of the word into a variable:</p>
<pre><code>regexp {\mfoo(?!bar\M)(\w*)} $string -&gt; restOfWord</code></pre>
<p>Note that the whole matched substring has been placed in the variable
which is a name chosen to look nice given that we are not actually
interested in its contents.</p>
<p>Find the index of the word <strong>badger</strong> (in any case)
within a string and store that in the variable
<strong>location</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>regexp -indices {(?i)\mbadger\M} $string location</code></pre>
<p>This could also be written as a <em>basic</em> regular expression (as
opposed to using the default syntax of <em>advanced</em> regular
expressions) match by prefixing the expression with a suitable flag:</p>
<pre><code>regexp -indices {(?ib)\&lt;badger\&gt;} $string location</code></pre>
<p>This counts the number of octal digits in a string:</p>
<pre><code>regexp -all {[0-7]} $string</code></pre>
<p>This lists all words (consisting of all sequences of non-whitespace
characters) in a string, and is useful as a more powerful version of the
<strong>split</strong> command:</p>
<pre><code>regexp -all -inline {\S+} $string</code></pre>
