<p>uplevel - Execute a script in a different stack frame</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>uplevel</strong> ?<em>level</em>? <em>arg</em> ?<em>arg
...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>All of the <em>arg</em> arguments are concatenated as if they had
been passed to <strong>concat</strong>; the result is then evaluated in
the variable context indicated by <em>level</em>.
<strong>Uplevel</strong> returns the result of that evaluation.</p>
<p>If <em>level</em> is an integer then it gives a distance (up the
procedure calling stack) to move before executing the command. If
<em>level</em> consists of <strong>#</strong> followed by a number then
the number gives an absolute level number. If <em>level</em> is omitted
then it defaults to <strong>1</strong>. <em>Level</em> cannot be
defaulted if the first <em>command</em> argument starts with a digit or
<strong>#</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that procedure <strong>a</strong> was invoked
from top-level, and that it called <strong>b</strong>, and that
<strong>b</strong> called <strong>c</strong>. Suppose that
<strong>c</strong> invokes the <strong>uplevel</strong> command. If
<em>level</em> is <strong>1</strong> or <strong>#2</strong> or omitted,
then the command will be executed in the variable context of
<strong>b</strong>. If <em>level</em> is <strong>2</strong> or
<strong>#1</strong> then the command will be executed in the variable
context of <strong>a</strong>. If <em>level</em> is <strong>3</strong>
or <strong>#0</strong> then the command will be executed at top-level
(only global variables will be visible).</p>
<p>The <strong>uplevel</strong> command causes the invoking procedure to
disappear from the procedure calling stack while the command is being
executed. In the above example, suppose <strong>c</strong> invokes the
command</p>
<pre><code>uplevel 1 {set x 43; d}</code></pre>
<p>where <strong>d</strong> is another Tcl procedure. The
<strong>set</strong> command will modify the variable <strong>x</strong>
in <strong>b</strong>'s context, and <strong>d</strong> will execute at
level 3, as if called from <strong>b</strong>. If it in turn executes
the command</p>
<pre><code>uplevel {set x 42}</code></pre>
<p>then the <strong>set</strong> command will modify the same variable
<strong>x</strong> in <strong>b</strong>'s context: the procedure
<strong>c</strong> does not appear to be on the call stack when
<strong>d</strong> is executing. The <strong>info level</strong> command
may be used to obtain the level of the current procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Uplevel</strong> makes it possible to implement new control
constructs as Tcl procedures (for example, <strong>uplevel</strong>
could be used to implement the <strong>while</strong> construct as a Tcl
procedure).</p>
<p>The <strong>namespace eval</strong> and <strong>apply</strong>
commands offer other ways (besides procedure calls) that the Tcl naming
context can change. They add a call frame to the stack to represent the
namespace context. This means each <strong>namespace eval</strong>
command counts as another call level for <strong>uplevel</strong> and
<strong>upvar</strong> commands. For example, <strong>info level
1</strong> will return a list describing a command that is either the
outermost procedure call or the outermost <strong>namespace
eval</strong> command. Also, <strong>uplevel #0</strong> evaluates a
script at top-level in the outermost namespace (the global
namespace).</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>As stated above, the <strong>uplevel</strong> command is useful for
creating new control constructs. This example shows how (without error
handling) it can be used to create a <strong>do</strong> command that is
the counterpart of <strong>while</strong> except for always performing
the test after running the loop body:</p>
<pre><code>proc do {body while condition} {
    if {$while ne &quot;while&quot;} {
        error &quot;required word missing&quot;
    }
    set conditionCmd [list expr $condition]
    while {1} {
        uplevel 1 $body
        if {![uplevel 1 $conditionCmd]} {
            break
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
