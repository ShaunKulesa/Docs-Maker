<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>file</strong> <em>option</em> <em>name</em> ?<em>arg arg
...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command provides several operations on a file's name or
attributes. <em>Name</em> is the name of a file; if it starts with a
tilde, then tilde substitution is done before executing the command (see
the manual entry for <strong>filename</strong> for details).
<em>Option</em> indicates what to do with the file name. Any unique
abbreviation for <em>option</em> is acceptable. The valid options
are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>file atime</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>time</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string giving the time at which file <em>name</em>
was last accessed. If <em>time</em> is specified, it is an access time
to set for the file. The time is measured in the standard POSIX fashion
as seconds from a fixed starting time (often January 1, 1970). If the
file does not exist or its access time cannot be queried or set then an
error is generated. On Windows, FAT file systems do not support access
time.</p>

</dd>
<dt><strong>file attributes</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>option value

<dd>
<p>This subcommand returns or sets platform-specific values associated
with a file. The first form returns a list of the platform-specific
options and their values. The second form returns the value for the
given option. The third form sets one or more of the values. The values
are as follows:</p>
<p>On Unix, <strong>-group</strong> gets or sets the group name for the
file. A group id can be given to the command, but it returns a group
name. <strong>-owner</strong> gets or sets the user name of the owner of
the file. The command returns the owner name, but the numerical id can
be passed when setting the owner. <strong>-permissions</strong>
retrieves or sets a file's access permissions, using octal notation by
default. This option also provides limited support for setting
permissions using the symbolic notation accepted by the
<strong>chmod</strong> command, following the form
[<strong>ugo</strong>]?[[<strong>+-=</strong>][<strong>rwxst</strong>]<strong>,</strong>[...]].
Multiple permission specifications may be given, separated by commas.
E.g., <strong>u+s,go-rw</strong> would set the setuid bit for a file's
owner as well as remove read and write permission for the file's group
and other users. An <strong>ls</strong>-style string of the form
<strong>rwxrwxrwx</strong> is also accepted but must always be 9
characters long. E.g., <strong>rwxr-xr-t</strong> is equivalent to
<strong>01755</strong>. On versions of Unix supporting file flags,
<strong>-readonly</strong> returns the value of, or sets, or clears the
readonly attribute of a file, i.e., the user immutable flag
(<strong>uchg</strong>) to the <strong>chflags</strong> command.</p>
<p>On Windows, <strong>-archive</strong> gives the value or sets or
clears the archive attribute of the file. <strong>-hidden</strong> gives
the value or sets or clears the hidden attribute of the file.
<strong>-longname</strong> will expand each path element to its long
version. This attribute cannot be set. <strong>-readonly</strong> gives
the value or sets or clears the readonly attribute of the file.
<strong>-shortname</strong> gives a string where every path element is
replaced with its short (8.3) version of the name. This attribute cannot
be set. <strong>-system</strong> gives or sets or clears the value of
the system attribute of the file.</p>
<p>On Mac OS X and Darwin, <strong>-creator</strong> gives or sets the
Finder creator type of the file. <strong>-hidden</strong> gives or sets
or clears the hidden attribute of the file. <strong>-readonly</strong>
gives or sets or clears the readonly attribute of the file.
<strong>-rsrclength</strong> gives the length of the resource fork of
the file, this attribute can only be set to the value 0, which results
in the resource fork being stripped off the file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file channels</strong> ?<em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, returns a list of names of all
registered open channels in this interpreter. If <em>pattern</em> is
specified, only those names matching <em>pattern</em> are returned.
Matching is determined using the same rules as for <strong>string
match</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file copy</strong> ?<strong>-force</strong>?
?<strong>- -</strong>? <em>source</em> <em>target</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>file copy</strong> ?<strong>-force</strong>?
?<strong>- -</strong>? <em>source</em> ?<em>source</em> ...?
<em>targetDir</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The first form makes a copy of the file or directory <em>source</em>
under the pathname <em>target</em>. If <em>target</em> is an existing
directory, then the second form is used. The second form makes a copy
inside <em>targetDir</em> of each <em>source</em> file listed. If a
directory is specified as a <em>source</em>, then the contents of the
directory will be recursively copied into <em>targetDir</em>. Existing
files will not be overwritten unless the <strong>-force</strong> option
is specified (when Tcl will also attempt to adjust permissions on the
destination file or directory if that is necessary to allow the copy to
proceed). When copying within a single filesystem, <em>file copy</em>
will copy soft links (i.e. the links themselves are copied, not the
things they point to). Trying to overwrite a non-empty directory,
overwrite a directory with a file, or overwrite a file with a directory
will all result in errors even if <strong>-force</strong> was specified.
Arguments are processed in the order specified, halting at the first
error, if any. A <strong>- -</strong> marks the end of switches; the
argument following the <strong>- -</strong> will be treated as a
<em>source</em> even if it starts with a <strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file delete</strong> ?<strong>-force</strong>?
?<strong>- -</strong>? ?<em>pathname</em> ... ?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes the file or directory specified by each <em>pathname</em>
argument. Non-empty directories will be removed only if the
<strong>-force</strong> option is specified. When operating on symbolic
links, the links themselves will be deleted, not the objects they point
to. Trying to delete a non-existent file is not considered an error.
Trying to delete a read-only file will cause the file to be deleted,
even if the <strong>-force</strong> flags is not specified. If the
<strong>-force</strong> option is specified on a directory, Tcl will
attempt both to change permissions and move the current directory out of
the given path if that is necessary to allow the deletion to proceed.
Arguments are processed in the order specified, halting at the first
error, if any. A <strong>- -</strong> marks the end of switches; the
argument following the <strong>- -</strong> will be treated as a
<em>pathname</em> even if it starts with a <strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file dirname</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a name comprised of all of the path components in
<em>name</em> excluding the last element. If <em>name</em> is a relative
file name and only contains one path element, then returns If
<em>name</em> refers to a root directory, then the root directory is
returned. For example,</p>
<pre><code>file dirname c:/</code></pre>
<p>returns <strong>c:/</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that tilde substitution will only be performed if it is
necessary to complete the command. For example,</p>
<pre><code>file dirname ~/src/foo.c</code></pre>
<p>returns <strong>~/src</strong>, whereas</p>
<pre><code>file dirname ~</code></pre>
<p>returns <strong>/home</strong> (or something similar).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file executable</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>1</strong> if file <em>name</em> is executable by the
current user, <strong>0</strong> otherwise. On Windows, which does not
have an executable attribute, the command treats all directories and any
files with extensions <strong>exe</strong>, <strong>com</strong>,
<strong>cmd</strong> or <strong>bat</strong> as executable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file exists</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>1</strong> if file <em>name</em> exists and the
current user has search privileges for the directories leading to it,
<strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file extension</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns all of the characters in <em>name</em> after and including
the last dot in the last element of <em>name</em>. If there is no dot in
the last element of <em>name</em> then returns the empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file isdirectory</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>1</strong> if file <em>name</em> is a directory,
<strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file isfile</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>1</strong> if file <em>name</em> is a regular file,
<strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file join</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>name ...</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Takes one or more file names and combines them, using the correct
path separator for the current platform. If a particular <em>name</em>
is relative, then it will be joined to the previous file name argument.
Otherwise, any earlier arguments will be discarded, and joining will
proceed from the current argument. For example,</p>
<pre><code>file join a b /foo bar</code></pre>
<p>returns <strong>/foo/bar</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that any of the names can contain separators, and that the
result is always canonical for the current platform: <strong>/</strong>
for Unix and Windows.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file link</strong> ?<em>-linktype</em>? <em>linkName</em>
?<em>target</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If only one argument is given, that argument is assumed to be
<em>linkName</em>, and this command returns the value of the link given
by <em>linkName</em> (i.e. the name of the file it points to). If
<em>linkName</em> is not a link or its value cannot be read (as, for
example, seems to be the case with hard links, which look just like
ordinary files), then an error is returned.</p>
<p>If 2 arguments are given, then these are assumed to be
<em>linkName</em> and <em>target</em>. If <em>linkName</em> already
exists, or if <em>target</em> does not exist, an error will be returned.
Otherwise, Tcl creates a new link called <em>linkName</em> which points
to the existing filesystem object at <em>target</em> (which is also the
returned value), where the type of the link is platform-specific (on
Unix a symbolic link will be the default). This is useful for the case
where the user wishes to create a link in a cross-platform way, and does
not care what type of link is created.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to make a link of a specific type only, (and
signal an error if for some reason that is not possible), then the
optional <em>-linktype</em> argument should be given. Accepted values
for <em>-linktype</em> are and</p>
<p>On Unix, symbolic links can be made to relative paths, and those
paths must be relative to the actual <em>linkName</em>'s location (not
to the cwd), but on all other platforms where relative links are not
supported, target paths will always be converted to absolute, normalized
form before the link is created (and therefore relative paths are
interpreted as relative to the cwd). Furthermore, paths are always
expanded to absolute form. When creating links on filesystems that
either do not support any links, or do not support the specific type
requested, an error message will be returned. Most Unix platforms
support both symbolic and hard links (the latter for files only).
Windows supports symbolic directory links and hard file links on NTFS
drives.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file lstat</strong> <em>name varName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as <strong>stat</strong> option (see below) except uses the
<em>lstat</em> kernel call instead of <em>stat</em>. This means that if
<em>name</em> refers to a symbolic link the information returned in
<em>varName</em> is for the link rather than the file it refers to. On
systems that do not support symbolic links this option behaves exactly
the same as the <strong>stat</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file mkdir</strong> ?<em>dir</em> ...?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates each directory specified. For each pathname <em>dir</em>
specified, this command will create all non-existing parent directories
as well as <em>dir</em> itself. If an existing directory is specified,
then no action is taken and no error is returned. Trying to overwrite an
existing file with a directory will result in an error. Arguments are
processed in the order specified, halting at the first error, if
any.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file mtime</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>time</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string giving the time at which file <em>name</em>
was last modified. If <em>time</em> is specified, it is a modification
time to set for the file (equivalent to Unix <strong>touch</strong>).
The time is measured in the standard POSIX fashion as seconds from a
fixed starting time (often January 1, 1970). If the file does not exist
or its modified time cannot be queried or set then an error is
generated.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file nativename</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the platform-specific name of the file. This is useful if the
filename is needed to pass to a platform-specific call, such as to a
subprocess via <strong>exec</strong> under Windows (see
<strong>EXAMPLES</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file normalize</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a unique normalized path representation for the file-system
object (file, directory, link, etc), whose string value can be used as a
unique identifier for it. A normalized path is an absolute path which
has all and removed. Also it is one which is in the format for the
native platform. On Unix, this means the segments leading up to the path
must be free of symbolic links/aliases (but the very last path component
may be a symbolic link), and on Windows it also means we want the long
form with that form's case-dependence (which gives us a unique,
case-dependent path). The one exception concerning the last link in the
path is necessary, because Tcl or the user may wish to operate on the
actual symbolic link itself (for example <strong>file delete</strong>,
<strong>file rename</strong>, <strong>file copy</strong> are defined to
operate on symbolic links, not on the things that they point to).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file owned</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>1</strong> if file <em>name</em> is owned by the
current user, <strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file pathtype</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns one of <strong>absolute</strong>, <strong>relative</strong>,
<strong>volumerelative</strong>. If <em>name</em> refers to a specific
file on a specific volume, the path type will be
<strong>absolute</strong>. If <em>name</em> refers to a file relative to
the current working directory, then the path type will be
<strong>relative</strong>. If <em>name</em> refers to a file relative to
the current working directory on a specified volume, or to a specific
file on the current working volume, then the path type is
<strong>volumerelative</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file readable</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>1</strong> if file <em>name</em> is readable by the
current user, <strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file readlink</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the value of the symbolic link given by <em>name</em>
(i.e. the name of the file it points to). If <em>name</em> is not a
symbolic link or its value cannot be read, then an error is returned. On
systems that do not support symbolic links this option is undefined.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file rename</strong> ?<strong>-force</strong>?
?<strong>- -</strong>? <em>source</em> <em>target</em></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><strong>file rename</strong> ?<strong>-force</strong>?
?<strong>- -</strong>? <em>source</em> ?<em>source</em> ...?
<em>targetDir</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The first form takes the file or directory specified by pathname
<em>source</em> and renames it to <em>target</em>, moving the file if
the pathname <em>target</em> specifies a name in a different directory.
If <em>target</em> is an existing directory, then the second form is
used. The second form moves each <em>source</em> file or directory into
the directory <em>targetDir</em>. Existing files will not be overwritten
unless the <strong>-force</strong> option is specified. When operating
inside a single filesystem, Tcl will rename symbolic links rather than
the things that they point to. Trying to overwrite a non-empty
directory, overwrite a directory with a file, or a file with a directory
will all result in errors. Arguments are processed in the order
specified, halting at the first error, if any. A <strong>- -</strong>
marks the end of switches; the argument following the
<strong>- -</strong> will be treated as a <em>source</em> even if it
starts with a <strong>-</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file rootname</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns all of the characters in <em>name</em> up to but not
including the last character in the last component of name. If the last
component of <em>name</em> does not contain a dot, then returns
<em>name</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file separator</strong> ?<em>name</em>?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If no argument is given, returns the character which is used to
separate path segments for native files on this platform. If a path is
given, the filesystem responsible for that path is asked to return its
separator character. If no file system accepts <em>name</em>, an error
is generated.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file size</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a decimal string giving the size of file <em>name</em> in
bytes. If the file does not exist or its size cannot be queried then an
error is generated.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file split</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list whose elements are the path components in
<em>name</em>. The first element of the list will have the same path
type as <em>name</em>. All other elements will be relative. Path
separators will be discarded unless they are needed to ensure that an
element is unambiguously relative. For example, under Unix</p>
<pre><code>file split /foo/~bar/baz</code></pre>
<p>returns to ensure that later commands that use the third component do
not attempt to perform tilde substitution.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file stat</strong> <em>name varName</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invokes the <strong>stat</strong> kernel call on <em>name</em>, and
uses the variable given by <em>varName</em> to hold information returned
from the kernel call. <em>VarName</em> is treated as an array variable,
and the following elements of that variable are set:
<strong>atime</strong>, <strong>ctime</strong>, <strong>dev</strong>,
<strong>gid</strong>, <strong>ino</strong>, <strong>mode</strong>,
<strong>mtime</strong>, <strong>nlink</strong>, <strong>size</strong>,
<strong>type</strong>, <strong>uid</strong>. Each element except
<strong>type</strong> is a decimal string with the value of the
corresponding field from the <strong>stat</strong> return structure; see
the manual entry for <strong>stat</strong> for details on the meanings
of the values. The <strong>type</strong> element gives the type of the
file in the same form returned by the command <strong>file
type</strong>. This command returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file system</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of one or two elements, the first of which is the name
of the filesystem to use for the file, and the second, if given, an
arbitrary string representing the filesystem-specific nature or type of
the location within that filesystem. If a filesystem only supports one
type of file, the second element may not be supplied. For example the
native files have a first element and a second element which when given
is a platform-specific type name for the file's system (e.g. on
Windows). A generic virtual file system might return the list to
represent a file on a remote ftp site mounted as a virtual filesystem
through an extension called If the file does not belong to any
filesystem, an error is generated.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file tail</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns all of the characters in the last filesystem component of
<em>name</em>. Any trailing directory separator in <em>name</em> is
ignored. If <em>name</em> contains no separators then returns
<em>name</em>. So, <strong>file tail a/b</strong>, <strong>file tail
a/b/</strong> and <strong>file tail b</strong> all return
<strong>b</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file tempfile</strong> ?<em>nameVar</em>?
?<em>template</em>?</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Creates a temporary file and returns a read-write channel opened on
that file. If the <em>nameVar</em> is given, it specifies a variable
that the name of the temporary file will be written into; if absent, Tcl
will attempt to arrange for the temporary file to be deleted once it is
no longer required. If the <em>template</em> is present, it specifies
parts of the template of the filename to use when creating it (such as
the directory, base-name or extension) though some platforms may ignore
some or all of these parts and use a built-in default instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that temporary files are <em>only</em> ever created on the
native filesystem. As such, they can be relied upon to be used with
operating-system native APIs and external programs that require a
filename.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>file type</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a string giving the type of file <em>name</em>, which will be
one of <strong>file</strong>, <strong>directory</strong>,
<strong>characterSpecial</strong>, <strong>blockSpecial</strong>,
<strong>fifo</strong>, <strong>link</strong>, or
<strong>socket</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file volumes</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the absolute paths to the volumes mounted on the system, as a
proper Tcl list. Without any virtual filesystems mounted as root
volumes, on UNIX, the command will always return since all filesystems
are locally mounted. On Windows, it will return a list of the available
local drives (e.g. If any virtual filesystem has mounted additional
volumes, they will be in the returned list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>file writable</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <strong>1</strong> if file <em>name</em> is writable by the
current user, <strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
