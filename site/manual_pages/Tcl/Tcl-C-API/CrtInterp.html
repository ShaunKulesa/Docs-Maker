<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateInterp</strong> creates a new interpreter structure
and returns a token for it. The token is required in calls to most other
Tcl procedures, such as <strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>, and <strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong>. The
token returned by <strong>Tcl_CreateInterp</strong> may only be passed
to Tcl routines called from the same thread as the original
<strong>Tcl_CreateInterp</strong> call. It is not safe for multiple
threads to pass the same token to Tcl's routines. The new interpreter is
initialized with the built-in Tcl commands and with standard variables
like <strong>tcl_platform</strong> and <strong>env</strong>. To bind in
additional commands, call <strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>, and to
create additional variables, call <strong>Tcl_SetVar</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> marks an interpreter as deleted;
the interpreter will eventually be deleted when all calls to
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> for it have been matched by calls to
<strong>Tcl_Release</strong>. At that time, all of the resources
associated with it, including variables, procedures, and
application-specific command bindings, will be deleted. After
<strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> returns any attempt to use
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> on the interpreter will fail and return
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. After the call to
<strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> it is safe to examine the
interpreter's result, query or set the values of variables, define,
undefine or retrieve procedures, and examine the runtime evaluation
stack. See below, in the section <strong>INTERPRETERS AND MEMORY
MANAGEMENT</strong> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_InterpDeleted</strong> returns nonzero if
<strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> was called with <em>interp</em> as its
argument; this indicates that the interpreter will eventually be
deleted, when the last call to <strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> for it is
matched by a call to <strong>Tcl_Release</strong>. If nonzero is
returned, further calls to <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> in this interpreter
will return <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_InterpDeleted</strong> is useful in deletion callbacks to
distinguish between when only the memory the callback is responsible for
is being deleted and when the whole interpreter is being deleted. In the
former case the callback may recreate the data being deleted, but this
would lead to an infinite loop if the interpreter were being
deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_InterpActive</strong> is useful for determining whether
there is any execution of scripts ongoing in an interpreter, which is a
useful piece of information when Tcl is embedded in a garbage-collected
environment and it becomes necessary to determine whether the
interpreter is a candidate for deletion. The function returns a true
value if the interpreter has at least one active execution running
inside it, and a false value otherwise.</p>
<h1 id="interpreters-and-memory-management">INTERPRETERS AND MEMORY
MANAGEMENT</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> can be called at any time on an
interpreter that may be used by nested evaluations and C code in various
extensions. Tcl implements a simple mechanism that allows callers to use
interpreters without worrying about the interpreter being deleted in a
nested call, and without requiring special code to protect the
interpreter, in most cases. This mechanism ensures that nested uses of
an interpreter can safely continue using it even after
<strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> is called.</p>
<p>The mechanism relies on matching up calls to
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> with calls to
<strong>Tcl_Release</strong>. If <strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> has
been called, only when the last call to <strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> is
matched by a call to <strong>Tcl_Release</strong>, will the interpreter
be freed. See the manual entry for <strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> for a
description of these functions.</p>
<p>The rules for when the user of an interpreter must call
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Release</strong> are
simple:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Interpreters Passed As Arguments</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Functions that are passed an interpreter as an argument can safely
use the interpreter without any special protection. Thus, when you write
an extension consisting of new Tcl commands, no special code is needed
to protect interpreters received as arguments. This covers the majority
of all uses.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Interpreter Creation And Deletion</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a new interpreter is created and used in a call to
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>, <strong>Tcl_VarEval</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_GlobalEval</strong>, <strong>Tcl_SetVar</strong>, or
<strong>Tcl_GetVar</strong>, a pair of calls to
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Release</strong> should be
wrapped around all uses of the interpreter. Remember that it is unsafe
to use the interpreter once <strong>Tcl_Release</strong> has been
called. To ensure that the interpreter is properly deleted when it is no
longer needed, call <strong>Tcl_InterpDeleted</strong> to test if some
other code already called <strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong>; if not,
call <strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> before calling
<strong>Tcl_Release</strong> in your own code.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Retrieving An Interpreter From A Data
Structure</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When an interpreter is retrieved from a data structure (e.g. the
client data of a callback) for use in one of the evaluation functions
(<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>, <strong>Tcl_VarEval</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_GlobalEval</strong>, <strong>Tcl_EvalObjv</strong>, etc.) or
variable access functions (<strong>Tcl_SetVar</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_GetVar</strong>, <strong>Tcl_SetVar2Ex</strong>, etc.), a
pair of calls to <strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_Release</strong> should be wrapped around all uses of the
interpreter; it is unsafe to reuse the interpreter once
<strong>Tcl_Release</strong> has been called. If an interpreter is
stored inside a callback data structure, an appropriate deletion cleanup
mechanism should be set up by the code that creates the data structure
so that the interpreter is removed from the data structure (e.g. by
setting the field to NULL) when the interpreter is deleted. Otherwise,
you may be using an interpreter that has been freed and whose memory may
already have been reused.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All uses of interpreters in Tcl and Tk have already been protected.
Extension writers should ensure that their code also properly protects
any additional interpreters used, as described above.</p>
<p>Note that the protection mechanisms do not work well with
conventional garbage collection systems. When in such a managed
environment, <strong>Tcl_InterpActive</strong> should be used to
determine when an interpreter is a candidate for deletion due to
inactivity.</p>
