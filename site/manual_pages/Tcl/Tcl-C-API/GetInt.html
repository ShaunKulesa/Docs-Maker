<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures convert from strings to integers or double-precision
floating-point values or booleans (represented as 0- or 1-valued
integers). Each of the procedures takes a <em>src</em> argument,
converts it to an internal form of a particular type, and stores the
converted value at the location indicated by the procedure's third
argument. If all goes well, each of the procedures returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>. If <em>src</em> does not have the proper syntax
for the desired type then <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned, an
error message is left in the interpreter's result, and nothing is stored
at *<em>intPtr</em> or *<em>doublePtr</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetInt</strong> expects <em>src</em> to consist of a
collection of integer digits, optionally signed and optionally preceded
and followed by white space. If the first two characters of <em>src</em>
after the optional white space and sign are then <em>src</em> is
expected to be in hexadecimal form; otherwise, if the first such
characters are then <em>src</em> is expected to be in octal form;
otherwise, if the first such characters are then <em>src</em> is
expected to be in binary form; otherwise, if the first such character is
then <em>src</em> is expected to be in octal form; otherwise,
<em>src</em> is expected to be in decimal form.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetDouble</strong> expects <em>src</em> to consist of a
floating-point number, which is: white space; a sign; a sequence of
digits; a decimal point a sequence of digits; the letter a signed
decimal exponent; and more white space. Any of the fields may be
omitted, except that the digits either before or after the decimal point
must be present and if the is present then it must be followed by the
exponent number. If there are no fields apart from the sign and initial
sequence of digits (i.e., no decimal point or exponent indicator), that
initial sequence of digits should take one of the forms that
<strong>Tcl_GetInt</strong> supports, described above. The use of as a
decimal point is not supported nor should any other sort of inter-digit
separator be present.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetBoolean</strong> expects <em>src</em> to specify a
boolean value. If <em>src</em> is any of <strong>0</strong>,
<strong>false</strong>, <strong>no</strong>, or <strong>off</strong>,
then <strong>Tcl_GetBoolean</strong> stores a zero value at
<em>*intPtr</em>. If <em>src</em> is any of <strong>1</strong>,
<strong>true</strong>, <strong>yes</strong>, or <strong>on</strong>,
then 1 is stored at <em>*intPtr</em>. Any of these values may be
abbreviated, and upper-case spellings are also acceptable.</p>
