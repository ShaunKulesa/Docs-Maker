<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong> defines a new command in
<em>interp</em> and associates it with procedure <em>proc</em> such that
whenever <em>cmdName</em> is invoked as a Tcl command (via a call to
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>) the Tcl interpreter will call <em>proc</em>
to process the command. It differs from
<strong>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</strong> in that a new string-based command
is defined; that is, a command procedure is defined that takes an array
of argument strings instead of values. The value-based command
procedures registered by <strong>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</strong> can
execute significantly faster than the string-based command procedures
defined by <strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>. This is because they take
Tcl values as arguments and those values can retain an internal
representation that can be manipulated more efficiently. Also, Tcl's
interpreter now uses values internally. In order to invoke a
string-based command procedure registered by
<strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>, it must generate and fetch a string
representation from each argument value before the call. New commands
should be defined using <strong>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</strong>. We
support <strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong> for backwards
compatibility.</p>
<p>The procedures <strong>Tcl_DeleteCommand</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_GetCommandInfo</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</strong> are used in conjunction with
<strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong> will delete an existing command
<em>cmdName</em>, if one is already associated with the interpreter. It
returns a token that may be used to refer to the command in subsequent
calls to <strong>Tcl_GetCommandName</strong>. If <em>cmdName</em>
contains any <strong>::</strong> namespace qualifiers, then the command
is added to the specified namespace; otherwise the command is added to
the global namespace. If <strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong> is called
for an interpreter that is in the process of being deleted, then it does
not create a new command and it returns NULL. <em>Proc</em> should have
arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tcl_CmdProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_CmdProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        int argc,
        const char *argv[]);</code></pre>
<p>When <em>proc</em> is invoked the <em>clientData</em> and
<em>interp</em> parameters will be copies of the <em>clientData</em> and
<em>interp</em> arguments given to <strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>.
Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to an application-specific data
structure that describes what to do when the command procedure is
invoked. <em>Argc</em> and <em>argv</em> describe the arguments to the
command, <em>argc</em> giving the number of arguments (including the
command name) and <em>argv</em> giving the values of the arguments as
strings. The <em>argv</em> array will contain <em>argc</em>+1 values;
the first <em>argc</em> values point to the argument strings, and the
last value is NULL. Note that the argument strings should not be
modified as they may point to constant strings or may be shared with
other parts of the interpreter.</p>
<p>Note that the argument strings are encoded in normalized UTF-8 since
version 8.1 of Tcl.</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> must return an integer code that is expected to be one
of <strong>TCL_OK</strong>, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>,
<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>, <strong>TCL_BREAK</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_CONTINUE</strong>. See the Tcl overview man page for details
on what these codes mean. Most normal commands will only return
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. In addition,
<em>proc</em> must set the interpreter result; in the case of a
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> return code this gives the result of the
command, and in the case of <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> it gives an error
message. The <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> procedure provides an easy
interface for setting the return value; for complete details on how the
interpreter result field is managed, see the <strong>Tcl_Interp</strong>
man page. Before invoking a command procedure, <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>
sets the interpreter result to point to an empty string, so simple
commands can return an empty result by doing nothing at all.</p>
<p>The contents of the <em>argv</em> array belong to Tcl and are not
guaranteed to persist once <em>proc</em> returns: <em>proc</em> should
not modify them, nor should it set the interpreter result to point
anywhere within the <em>argv</em> values. Call
<strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> with status <strong>TCL_VOLATILE</strong>
if you want to return something from the <em>argv</em> array.</p>
<p><em>DeleteProc</em> will be invoked when (if) <em>cmdName</em> is
deleted. This can occur through a call to
<strong>Tcl_DeleteCommand</strong> or <strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong>,
or by replacing <em>cmdName</em> in another call to
<strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>. <em>DeleteProc</em> is invoked
before the command is deleted, and gives the application an opportunity
to release any structures associated with the command.
<em>DeleteProc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tcl_CmdDeleteProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_CmdDeleteProc(
        ClientData clientData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> argument will be the same as the
<em>clientData</em> argument passed to
<strong>Tcl_CreateCommand</strong>.</p>
