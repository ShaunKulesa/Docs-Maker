<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tcl_StaticPackage - make a statically linked package available via
the 'load' command</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

Tcl_StaticPackage(interp, prefix, initProc, safeInitProc)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>If not NULL, points to an interpreter into which the package has
already been loaded (i.e., the caller has already invoked the
appropriate initialization procedure). NULL means the package has not
yet been incorporated into any interpreter.</p>
<p>Prefix for library initialization function; should be properly
capitalized (first letter upper-case, all others lower-case).</p>
<p>Procedure to invoke to incorporate this package into a trusted
interpreter.</p>
<p>Procedure to call to incorporate this package into a safe interpreter
(one that will execute untrusted scripts). NULL means the package cannot
be used in safe interpreters.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This procedure may be invoked to announce that a package has been
linked statically with a Tcl application and, optionally, that it has
already been loaded into an interpreter. Once
<strong>Tcl_StaticPackage</strong> has been invoked for a package, it
may be loaded into interpreters using the <strong>load</strong> command.
<strong>Tcl_StaticPackage</strong> is normally invoked only by the
<strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> procedure for the application, not by
packages for themselves (<strong>Tcl_StaticPackage</strong> should only
be invoked for statically loaded packages, and code in the package
itself should not need to know whether the package is dynamically or
statically loaded).</p>
<p>When the <strong>load</strong> command is used later to load the
package into an interpreter, one of <em>initProc</em> and
<em>safeInitProc</em> will be invoked, depending on whether the target
interpreter is safe or not. <em>initProc</em> and <em>safeInitProc</em>
must both match the following prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument identifies the interpreter in which the
package is to be loaded. The initialization procedure must return
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> to indicate
whether or not it completed successfully; in the event of an error it
should set the interpreter's result to point to an error message. The
result or error from the initialization procedure will be returned as
the result of the <strong>load</strong> command that caused the
initialization procedure to be invoked.</p>
