<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter in which to cancel the script.</p>
<p>Error message to use in the cancellation, or NULL to use a default
message. If not NULL, this object will have its reference count
decremented before <strong>Tcl_CancelEval</strong> returns.</p>
<p>ORed combination of flag bits that specify additional options. For
<strong>Tcl_CancelEval</strong>, only <strong>TCL_CANCEL_UNWIND</strong>
is currently supported. For <strong>Tcl_Canceled</strong>, only
<strong>TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG</strong> and
<strong>TCL_CANCEL_UNWIND</strong> are currently supported.</p>
<p>Currently reserved for future use. It should be set to NULL.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_CancelEval</strong> cancels or unwinds the script in
progress soon after the next invocation of asynchronous handlers,
causing <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> to be the return code for that
script. This function is thread-safe and may be called from any thread
in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Canceled</strong> checks if the script in progress has
been canceled and returns <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if it has.
Otherwise, <strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned. Extensions can use this
function to check to see if they should abort a long running command.
This function is thread sensitive and may only be called from the thread
the interpreter was created in.</p>
<h2 id="flag-bits">FLAG BITS</h2>
<p>Any ORed combination of the following values may be used for the
<em>flags</em> argument to procedures such as
<strong>Tcl_CancelEval</strong>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>TCL_CANCEL_UNWIND</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag is used by <strong>Tcl_CancelEval</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_Canceled</strong>. For <strong>Tcl_CancelEval</strong>, if
this flag is set, the script in progress is canceled and the evaluation
stack for the interpreter is unwound. For <strong>Tcl_Canceled</strong>,
if this flag is set, the script in progress is considered to be canceled
only if the evaluation stack for the interpreter is being unwound.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag is only used by <strong>Tcl_Canceled</strong>; it is
ignored by other procedures. If an error is returned and this bit is set
in <em>flags</em>, then an error message will be left in the
interpreter's result, where it can be retrieved with
<strong>Tcl_GetObjResult</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_GetStringResult</strong>. If this flag bit is not set then
no error message is left and the interpreter's result will not be
modified.</p>
