<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A hash table consists of zero or more entries, each consisting of a
key and a value. Given the key for an entry, the hashing routines can
very quickly locate the entry, and hence its value. There may be at most
one entry in a hash table with a particular key, but many entries may
have the same value. Keys can take one of four forms: strings, one-word
values, integer arrays, or custom keys defined by a Tcl_HashKeyType
structure (See section <strong>THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</strong>
below). All of the keys in a given table have the same form, which is
specified when the table is initialized.</p>
<p>The value of a hash table entry can be anything that fits in the same
space as a pointer. Values for hash table entries are managed entirely
by clients, not by the hash module itself. Typically each entry's value
is a pointer to a data structure managed by client code.</p>
<p>Hash tables grow gracefully as the number of entries increases, so
that there are always less than three entries per hash bucket, on
average. This allows for fast lookups regardless of the number of
entries in a table.</p>
<p>The core provides three functions for the initialization of hash
tables, Tcl_InitHashTable, Tcl_InitObjHashTable and
Tcl_InitCustomHashTable.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_InitHashTable</strong> initializes a structure that
describes a new hash table. The space for the structure is provided by
the caller, not by the hash module. The value of <em>keyType</em>
indicates what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the table.
All of the key types described later are allowed, with the exception of
<strong>TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS</strong> and
<strong>TCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_InitObjHashTable</strong> is a wrapper around
<strong>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</strong> and initializes a hash table
whose keys are Tcl_Obj *.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</strong> initializes a structure that
describes a new hash table. The space for the structure is provided by
the caller, not by the hash module. The value of <em>keyType</em>
indicates what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the table.
<em>KeyType</em> must have one of the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>TCL_STRING_KEYS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Keys are null-terminated strings. They are passed to hashing routines
using the address of the first character of the string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Keys are single-word values; they are passed to hashing routines and
stored in hash table entries as values. The pointer value is the key; it
need not (and usually does not) actually point to a string.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Keys are of arbitrary type, and are stored in the entry. Hashing and
comparison is determined by <em>typePtr</em>. The Tcl_HashKeyType
structure is described in the section <strong>THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE
STRUCTURE</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Keys are pointers to an arbitrary type, and are stored in the entry.
Hashing and comparison is determined by <em>typePtr</em>. The
Tcl_HashKeyType structure is described in the section <strong>THE
TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>other</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <em>keyType</em> is not one of the above, then it must be an
integer value greater than 1. In this case the keys will be arrays of
values, where <em>keyType</em> gives the number of ints in each key.
This allows structures to be used as keys. All keys must have the same
size. Array keys are passed into hashing functions using the address of
the first int in the array.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</strong> deletes all of the entries in a
hash table and frees up the memory associated with the table's bucket
array and entries. It does not free the actual table structure (pointed
to by <em>tablePtr</em>), since that memory is assumed to be managed by
the client. <strong>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</strong> also does not free or
otherwise manipulate the values of the hash table entries. If the entry
values point to dynamically-allocated memory, then it is the client's
responsibility to free these structures before deleting the table.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</strong> locates the entry corresponding
to a particular key, creating a new entry in the table if there was not
already one with the given key. If an entry already existed with the
given key then <em>*newPtr</em> is set to zero. If a new entry was
created, then <em>*newPtr</em> is set to a non-zero value and the value
of the new entry will be set to zero. The return value from
<strong>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</strong> is a pointer to the entry, which
may be used to retrieve and modify the entry's value or to delete the
entry from the table.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteHashEntry</strong> will remove an existing entry
from a table. The memory associated with the entry itself will be freed,
but the client is responsible for any cleanup associated with the
entry's value, such as freeing a structure that it points to.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FindHashEntry</strong> is similar to
<strong>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</strong> except that it does not create a
new entry if the key doesn't exist; instead, it returns NULL as
result.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetHashValue</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetHashValue</strong> are used to read and write an entry's
value, respectively. Values are stored and retrieved as type which is
large enough to hold a pointer value. On almost all machines this is
large enough to hold an integer value too.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetHashKey</strong> returns the key for a given hash
table entry, either as a pointer to a string, a one-word key, or as a
pointer to the first word of an array of integers, depending on the
<em>keyType</em> used to create a hash table. In all cases
<strong>Tcl_GetHashKey</strong> returns a result with type When the key
is a string or array, the result of <strong>Tcl_GetHashKey</strong>
points to information in the table entry; this information will remain
valid until the entry is deleted or its table is deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_NextHashEntry</strong> may be used to scan all of the
entries in a hash table. A structure of type provided by the client, is
used to keep track of progress through the table.
<strong>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</strong> initializes the search record and
returns the first entry in the table (or NULL if the table is empty).
Each subsequent call to <strong>Tcl_NextHashEntry</strong> returns the
next entry in the table or NULL if the end of the table has been
reached. A call to <strong>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</strong> followed by calls
to <strong>Tcl_NextHashEntry</strong> will return each of the entries in
the table exactly once, in an arbitrary order. It is inadvisable to
modify the structure of the table, e.g.Â by creating or deleting entries,
while the search is in progress, with the exception of deleting the
entry returned by <strong>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_NextHashEntry</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_HashStats</strong> returns a dynamically-allocated string
with overall information about a hash table, such as the number of
entries it contains, the number of buckets in its hash array, and the
utilization of the buckets. It is the caller's responsibility to free
the result string by passing it to <strong>ckfree</strong>.</p>
<p>The header file <strong>tcl.h</strong> defines the actual data
structures used to implement hash tables. This is necessary so that
clients can allocate Tcl_HashTable structures and so that macros can be
used to read and write the values of entries. However, users of the
hashing routines should never refer directly to any of the fields of any
of the hash-related data structures; use the procedures and macros
defined here.</p>
<h1 id="the-tcl_hashkeytype-structure">THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE
STRUCTURE</h1>
<p>Extension writers can define new hash key types by defining four
procedures, initializing a <strong>Tcl_HashKeyType</strong> structure to
describe the type, and calling <strong>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</strong>.
The <strong>Tcl_HashKeyType</strong> structure is defined as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tcl_HashKeyType {
    int version;
    int flags;
    Tcl_HashKeyProc *hashKeyProc;
    Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc *compareKeysProc;
    Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc *allocEntryProc;
    Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc *freeEntryProc;
} Tcl_HashKeyType;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>version</em> member is the version of the table. If this
structure is extended in future then the version can be used to
distinguish between different structures. It should be set to
<strong>TCL_HASH_KEY_TYPE_VERSION</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>flags</em> member is 0 or one or more of the following values
OR'ed together:</p>
<dl>
<dt>TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH</dt>
<dd>
<p>There are some things, pointers for example which do not hash well
because they do not use the lower bits. If this flag is set then the
hash table will attempt to rectify this by randomizing the bits and then
using the upper N bits as the index into the table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_HASH_KEY_SYSTEM_HASH</dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag forces Tcl to use the memory allocation procedures provided
by the operating system when allocating and freeing memory used to store
the hash table data structures, and not any of Tcl's own customized
memory allocation routines. This is important if the hash table is to be
used in the implementation of a custom set of allocation routines, or
something that a custom set of allocation routines might depend on, in
order to avoid any circular dependency.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <em>hashKeyProc</em> member contains the address of a function
called to calculate a hash value for the key.</p>
<pre><code>typedef unsigned int Tcl_HashKeyProc(
        Tcl_HashTable *tablePtr,
        void *keyPtr);</code></pre>
<p>If this is NULL then <em>keyPtr</em> is used and
<strong>TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH</strong> is assumed.</p>
<p>The <em>compareKeysProc</em> member contains the address of a
function called to compare two keys.</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc(
        void *keyPtr,
        Tcl_HashEntry *hPtr);</code></pre>
<p>If this is NULL then the <em>keyPtr</em> pointers are compared. If
the keys do not match then the function returns 0, otherwise it returns
1.</p>
<p>The <em>allocEntryProc</em> member contains the address of a function
called to allocate space for an entry and initialize the key and
clientData.</p>
<pre><code>typedef Tcl_HashEntry *Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc(
        Tcl_HashTable *tablePtr,
        void *keyPtr);</code></pre>
<p>If this is NULL then <strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong> is used to allocate
enough space for a Tcl_HashEntry, the key pointer is assigned to
key.oneWordValue and the clientData is set to NULL. String keys and
array keys use this function to allocate enough space for the entry and
the key in one block, rather than doing it in two blocks. This saves
space for a pointer to the key from the entry and another memory
allocation. Tcl_Obj* keys use this function to allocate enough space for
an entry and increment the reference count on the value.</p>
<p>The <em>freeEntryProc</em> member contains the address of a function
called to free space for an entry.</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc(
        Tcl_HashEntry *hPtr);</code></pre>
<p>If this is NULL then <strong>Tcl_Free</strong> is used to free the
space for the entry. Tcl_Obj* keys use this function to decrement the
reference count on the value.</p>
