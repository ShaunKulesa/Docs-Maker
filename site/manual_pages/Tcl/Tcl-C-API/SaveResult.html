<p>Interpreter for which state should be saved.</p>

<p>Pointer to location where interpreter result should be saved or

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These routines allows a C procedure to take a snapshot of the current
state of an interpreter so that it can be restored after a call to
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> or some other routine that modifies the
interpreter state. There are two triplets of routines meant to work
together.</p>
<p>The first triplet stores the snapshot of interpreter state in an
opaque token returned by <strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong>. That
token value may then be passed back to one of
<strong>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</strong>, depending on whether the interp
state is to be restored. So long as one of the latter two routines is
called, Tcl will take care of memory management.</p>
<p>The second triplet stores the snapshot of only the interpreter result
(not its complete state) in memory allocated by the caller. These
routines are passed a pointer to <strong>Tcl_SavedResult</strong> that
is used to store enough information to restore the interpreter result.
<strong>Tcl_SavedResult</strong> can be allocated on the stack of the
calling procedure. These routines do not save the state of any error
information in the interpreter (e.g.Â the <strong>-errorcode</strong> or
<strong>-errorinfo</strong> return options, when an error is in
progress).</p>
<p>Because the routines <strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</strong> perform a superset of the
functions provided by the other routines, any new code should only make
use of the more powerful routines. The older, weaker routines
<strong>Tcl_SaveResult</strong>, <strong>Tcl_RestoreResult</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_DiscardResult</strong> continue to exist only for the sake
of existing programs that may already be using them.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong> takes a snapshot of those
portions of interpreter state that make up the full result of script
evaluation. This include the interpreter result, the return code (passed
in as the <em>status</em> argument, and any return options, including
<strong>-errorinfo</strong> and <strong>-errorcode</strong> when an
error is in progress. This snapshot is returned as an opaque token of
type <strong>Tcl_InterpState</strong>. The call to
<strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong> does not itself change the state of
the interpreter. Unlike <strong>Tcl_SaveResult</strong>, it does not
reset the interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</strong> accepts a
<strong>Tcl_InterpState</strong> token previously returned by
<strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong> and restores the state of the
interp to the state held in that snapshot. The return value of
<strong>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</strong> is the status value originally
passed to <strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong> when the snapshot token
was created.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</strong> is called to release a
<strong>Tcl_InterpState</strong> token previously returned by
<strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong> when that snapshot is not to be
restored to an interp.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_InterpState</strong> token returned by
<strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong> must eventually be passed to either
<strong>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</strong> to avoid a memory leak. Once the
<strong>Tcl_InterpState</strong> token is passed to one of them, the
token is no longer valid and should not be used anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SaveResult</strong> moves the string and value results of
<em>interp</em> into the location specified by <em>statePtr</em>.
<strong>Tcl_SaveResult</strong> clears the result for <em>interp</em>
and leaves the result in its normal empty initialized state.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_RestoreResult</strong> moves the string and value results
from <em>statePtr</em> back into <em>interp</em>. Any result or error
that was already in the interpreter will be cleared. The
<em>statePtr</em> is left in an uninitialized state and cannot be used
until another call to <strong>Tcl_SaveResult</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DiscardResult</strong> releases the saved interpreter
state stored at <strong>statePtr</strong>. The state structure is left
in an uninitialized state and cannot be used until another call to
<strong>Tcl_SaveResult</strong>.</p>
<p>Once <strong>Tcl_SaveResult</strong> is called to save the
interpreter result, either <strong>Tcl_RestoreResult</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_DiscardResult</strong> must be called to properly clean up
the memory associated with the saved state.</p>
