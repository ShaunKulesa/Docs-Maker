<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_RegExpMatch</strong> determines whether its
<em>pattern</em> argument matches <em>regexp</em>, where <em>regexp</em>
is interpreted as a regular expression using the rules in the
<strong>re_syntax</strong> reference page. If there is a match then
<strong>Tcl_RegExpMatch</strong> returns 1. If there is no match then
<strong>Tcl_RegExpMatch</strong> returns 0. If an error occurs in the
matching process (e.g.Â <em>pattern</em> is not a valid regular
expression) then <strong>Tcl_RegExpMatch</strong> returns -1 and leaves
an error message in the interpreter result.
<strong>Tcl_RegExpMatchObj</strong> is similar to
<strong>Tcl_RegExpMatch</strong> except it operates on the Tcl values
<em>textObj</em> and <em>patObj</em> instead of UTF strings.
<strong>Tcl_RegExpMatchObj</strong> is generally more efficient than
<strong>Tcl_RegExpMatch</strong>, so it is the preferred interface.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_RegExpCompile</strong>, <strong>Tcl_RegExpExec</strong>,
and <strong>Tcl_RegExpRange</strong> provide lower-level access to the
regular expression pattern matcher. <strong>Tcl_RegExpCompile</strong>
compiles a regular expression string into the internal form used for
efficient pattern matching. The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
<strong>Tcl_RegExpExec</strong> or <strong>Tcl_RegExpRange</strong>. If
an error occurs while compiling the regular expression then
<strong>Tcl_RegExpCompile</strong> returns NULL and leaves an error
message in the interpreter result. Note: the return value from
<strong>Tcl_RegExpCompile</strong> is only valid up to the next call to
<strong>Tcl_RegExpCompile</strong>; it is not safe to retain these
values for long periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_RegExpExec</strong> executes the regular expression
pattern matcher. It returns 1 if <em>text</em> contains a range of
characters that match <em>regexp</em>, 0 if no match is found, and -1 if
an error occurs. In the case of an error,
<strong>Tcl_RegExpExec</strong> leaves an error message in the
interpreter result. When searching a string for multiple matches of a
pattern, it is important to distinguish between the start of the
original string and the start of the current search. For example, when
searching for the second occurrence of a match, the <em>text</em>
argument might point to the character just after the first match;
however, it is important for the pattern matcher to know that this is
not the start of the entire string, so that it does not allow atoms in
the pattern to match. The <em>start</em> argument provides this
information by pointing to the start of the overall string containing
<em>text</em>. <em>Start</em> will be less than or equal to
<em>text</em>; if it is less than <em>text</em> then no
<strong>^</strong> matches will be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_RegExpRange</strong> may be invoked after
<strong>Tcl_RegExpExec</strong> returns; it provides detailed
information about what ranges of the string matched what parts of the
pattern. <strong>Tcl_RegExpRange</strong> returns a pair of pointers in
<em>*startPtr</em> and <em>*endPtr</em> that identify a range of
characters in the source string for the most recent call to
<strong>Tcl_RegExpExec</strong>. <em>Index</em> indicates which of
several ranges is desired: if <em>index</em> is 0, information is
returned about the overall range of characters that matched the entire
pattern; otherwise, information is returned about the range of
characters that matched the <em>index</em>'th parenthesized
subexpression within the pattern. If there is no range corresponding to
<em>index</em> then NULL is stored in <em>*startPtr</em> and
<em>*endPtr</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_RegExpExecObj</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_RegExpGetInfo</strong> are value interfaces that provide the
most direct control of Henry Spencer's regular expression library. For
users that need to modify compilation and execution options directly, it
is recommended that you use these interfaces instead of calling the
internal regexp functions. These interfaces handle the details of UTF to
Unicode translations as well as providing improved performance through
caching in the pattern and string values.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj</strong> attempts to return a compiled
regular expression from the <em>patObj</em>. If the value does not
already contain a compiled regular expression it will attempt to create
one from the string in the value and assign it to the internal
representation of the <em>patObj</em>. The return value of this function
is of type <strong>Tcl_RegExp</strong>. The return value is a token for
this compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
<strong>Tcl_RegExpExecObj</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_RegExpGetInfo</strong>. If an error occurs while compiling
the regular expression then <strong>Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj</strong>
returns NULL and leaves an error message in the interpreter result. The
regular expression token can be used as long as the internal
representation of <em>patObj</em> refers to the compiled form. The
<em>cflags</em> argument is a bit-wise OR of zero or more of the
following flags that control the compilation of <em>patObj</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>

regular expression syntax recognized by common Unix utilities like
<strong>sed</strong> and <strong>grep</strong>. This is the default if
no flags are specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_REG_EXPANDED</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compile the regular expression (basic, extended, or advanced) using
an expanded syntax that allows comments and whitespace. This mode causes
non-backslashed non-bracket-expression white space and #-to-end-of-line

<dt><strong>TCL_REG_NOCASE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compile for matching that ignores upper/lower case distinctions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_REG_NEWLINE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compile for newline-sensitive matching. By default, newline is a
completely ordinary character with no special meaning in either regular
expressions or strings. With this flag, bracket expressions and never
match newline, matches an empty string after any newline in addition to
its normal function, and matches an empty string before any newline in
addition to its normal function. <strong>REG_NEWLINE</strong> is the
bit-wise OR of <strong>REG_NLSTOP</strong> and
<strong>REG_NLANCH</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_REG_NLSTOP</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compile for partial newline-sensitive matching, with the behavior of
bracket expressions and affected, but not the behavior of and In this
mode, bracket expressions and never match newline.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_REG_NLANCH</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compile for inverse partial newline-sensitive matching, with the

<dt><strong>TCL_REG_NOSUB</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compile for matching that reports only success or failure, not what

<strong>Tcl_RegExpRange</strong> will not report any match
information.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_REG_CANMATCH</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Compile for matching that reports the potential to complete a partial

</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Only one of <strong>TCL_REG_EXTENDED</strong>,
<strong>TCL_REG_ADVANCED</strong>, <strong>TCL_REG_BASIC</strong>, and
<strong>TCL_REG_QUOTE</strong> may be specified.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_RegExpExecObj</strong> executes the regular expression
pattern matcher. It returns 1 if <em>objPtr</em> contains a range of
characters that match <em>regexp</em>, 0 if no match is found, and -1 if
an error occurs. In the case of an error,
<strong>Tcl_RegExpExecObj</strong> leaves an error message in the
interpreter result. The <em>nmatches</em> value indicates to the matcher
how many subexpressions are of interest. If <em>nmatches</em> is 0, then
no subexpression match information is recorded, which may allow the
matcher to make various optimizations. If the value is -1, then all of
the subexpressions in the pattern are remembered. If the value is a
positive integer, then only that number of subexpressions will be
remembered. Matching begins at the specified Unicode character index
given by <em>offset</em>. Unlike <strong>Tcl_RegExpExec</strong>, the
behavior of anchors is not affected by the offset value. Instead the
behavior of the anchors is explicitly controlled by the <em>eflags</em>
argument, which is a bit-wise OR of zero or more of the following
flags:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>TCL_REG_NOTBOL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The starting character will not be treated as the beginning of a line
or the beginning of the string, so will not match there. Note that this
flag has no effect on how matches.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_REG_NOTEOL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The last character in the string will not be treated as the end of a
line or the end of the string, so will not match there. Note that this
flag has no effect on how matches.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tcl_RegExpGetInfo</strong> retrieves information about the
last match performed with a given regular expression <em>regexp</em>.
The <em>infoPtr</em> argument contains a pointer to a structure that is
defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
    int nsubs;
    Tcl_RegExpIndices *matches;
    long extendStart;
} Tcl_RegExpInfo;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>nsubs</em> field contains a count of the number of
parenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression. If the
<strong>TCL_REG_NOSUB</strong> was used, then this value will be zero.
The <em>matches</em> field points to an array of <em>nsubs</em>+1 values
that indicate the bounds of each subexpression matched. The first
element in the array refers to the range matched by the entire regular
expression, and subsequent elements refer to the parenthesized
subexpressions in the order that they appear in the pattern. Each
element is a structure that is defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
    long start;
    long end;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> values are Unicode character
indices relative to the offset location within <em>objPtr</em> where
matching began. The <em>start</em> index identifies the first character
of the matched subexpression. The <em>end</em> index identifies the
first character after the matched subexpression. If the subexpression
matched the empty string, then <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> will be
equal. If the subexpression did not participate in the match, then
<em>start</em> and <em>end</em> will be set to -1.</p>
<p>The <em>extendStart</em> field in <strong>Tcl_RegExpInfo</strong> is
only set if the <strong>TCL_REG_CANMATCH</strong> flag was used. It
indicates the first character in the string where a match could occur.
If a match was found, this will be the same as the beginning of the
current match. If no match was found, then it indicates the earliest
point at which a match might occur if additional text is appended to the
string. If it is no match is possible even with further text, this field
will be set to -1.</p>
