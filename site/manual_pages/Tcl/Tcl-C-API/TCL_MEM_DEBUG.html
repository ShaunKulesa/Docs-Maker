<p>TCL_MEM_DEBUG - Compile-time flag to enable Tcl memory debugging</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>When Tcl is compiled with <strong>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</strong> defined, a
powerful set of memory debugging aids is included in the compiled
binary. This includes C and Tcl functions which can aid with debugging
memory leaks, memory allocation overruns, and other memory related
errors.</p>
<h1 id="enabling-memory-debugging">ENABLING MEMORY DEBUGGING</h1>
<p>To enable memory debugging, Tcl should be recompiled from scratch
with <strong>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</strong> defined (e.g. by passing the
<em>--enable-symbols=mem</em> flag to the <em>configure</em> script when
building). This will also compile in a non-stub version of
<strong>Tcl_InitMemory</strong> to add the <strong>memory</strong>
command to Tcl.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</strong> must be either left defined for all
modules or undefined for all modules that are going to be linked
together. If they are not, link errors will occur, with either
<strong>Tcl_DbCkfree</strong> and <strong>Tcl_DbCkalloc</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Free</strong> being
undefined.</p>
<p>Once memory debugging support has been compiled into Tcl, the C
functions <strong>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory</strong>, and the Tcl
<strong>memory</strong> command can be used to validate and examine
memory usage.</p>
<h1 id="guard-zones">GUARD ZONES</h1>
<p>When memory debugging is enabled, whenever a call to
<strong>ckalloc</strong> is made, slightly more memory than requested is
allocated so the memory debugging code can keep track of the allocated
memory, and eight-byte are placed in front of and behind the space that
will be returned to the caller. (The sizes of the guard zones are
defined by the C #define <strong>LOW_GUARD_SIZE</strong> and #define
<strong>HIGH_GUARD_SIZE</strong> in the file
<em>generic/tclCkalloc.c</em> — it can be extended if you suspect large
overwrite problems, at some cost in performance.) A known pattern is
written into the guard zones and, on a call to <strong>ckfree</strong>,
the guard zones of the space being freed are checked to see if either
zone has been modified in any way. If one has been, the guard bytes and
their new contents are identified, and a or message is issued. The
message includes the address of the memory packet and the file name and
line number of the code that called <strong>ckfree</strong>. This allows
you to detect the common sorts of one-off problems, where not enough
space was allocated to contain the data written, for example.</p>
<h1 id="debugging-difficult-memory-corruption-problems">DEBUGGING
DIFFICULT MEMORY CORRUPTION PROBLEMS</h1>
<p>Normally, Tcl compiled with memory debugging enabled will make it
easy to isolate a corruption problem. Turning on memory validation with
the memory command can help isolate difficult problems. If you suspect
(or know) that corruption is occurring before the Tcl interpreter comes
up far enough for you to issue commands, you can set
<strong>MEM_VALIDATE</strong> define, recompile tclCkalloc.c and rebuild
Tcl. This will enable memory validation from the first call to
<strong>ckalloc</strong>, again, at a large performance impact.</p>
<p>If you are desperate and validating memory on every call to
<strong>ckalloc</strong> and <strong>ckfree</strong> is not enough, you
can explicitly call <strong>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</strong> directly at
any point. It takes a <em>char</em> * and an <em>int</em> which are
normally the filename and line number of the caller, but they can
actually be anything you want. Remember to remove the calls after you
find the problem.</p>
