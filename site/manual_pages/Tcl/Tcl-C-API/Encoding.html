<p>Interpreter to use for error reporting, or NULL if no error reporting
is desired.</p>
<p>Name of encoding to load.</p>
<p>The encoding to query, free, or use for converting text. If
<em>encoding</em> is NULL, the current system encoding is used.</p>
<p>Name of encoding to get token for.</p>
<p>Points to storage where encoding token is to be written.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</strong> functions, an array of
bytes in the specified encoding that are to be converted to UTF-8. For
the <strong>Tcl_UtfToExternal</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_WinUtfToTChar</strong> functions, an array of UTF-8
characters to be converted to the specified encoding.</p>
<p>An array of Windows TCHAR characters to convert to UTF-8.</p>
<p>Length of <em>src</em> or <em>tsrc</em> in bytes. If the length is
negative, the encoding-specific length of the string is used.</p>
<p>Pointer to an uninitialized or free <strong>Tcl_DString</strong> in
which the converted result will be stored.</p>
<p>Various flag bits OR-ed together. <strong>TCL_ENCODING_START</strong>
signifies that the source buffer is the first block in a (potentially
multi-block) input stream, telling the conversion routine to reset to an
initial state and perform any initialization that needs to occur before
the first byte is converted. <strong>TCL_ENCODING_END</strong> signifies
that the source buffer is the last block in a (potentially multi-block)
input stream, telling the conversion routine to perform any finalization
that needs to occur after the last byte is converted and then to reset
to an initial state. <strong>TCL_ENCODING_STOPONERROR</strong> signifies
that the conversion routine should return immediately upon reading a
source character that does not exist in the target encoding; otherwise a
default fallback character will automatically be substituted.</p>
<p>Used when converting a (generally long or indefinite length) byte
stream in a piece-by-piece fashion. The conversion routine stores its
current state in <em>*statePtr</em> after <em>src</em> (the buffer
containing the current piece) has been converted; that state information
must be passed back when converting the next piece of the stream so the
conversion routine knows what state it was in when it left off at the
end of the last piece. May be NULL, in which case the value specified
for <em>flags</em> is ignored and the source buffer is assumed to
contain the complete string to convert.</p>
<p>Buffer in which the converted result will be stored. No more than
<em>dstLen</em> bytes will be stored in <em>dst</em>.</p>
<p>The maximum length of the output buffer <em>dst</em> in bytes.</p>

output buffer as a result of the conversion. May be NULL.</p>
<p>Filled with the number of characters that correspond to the number of
bytes stored in the output buffer. May be NULL.</p>
<p>Storage for the prescribed system encoding name.</p>
<p>Structure that defines a new type of encoding.</p>
<p>List of filesystem directories in which to search for encoding data
files.</p>
<p>A path to the location of the encoding file.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>These routines convert between Tcl's internal character
representation, UTF-8, and character representations used by various
operating systems or file systems, such as Unicode, ASCII, or Shift-JIS.
When operating on strings, such as such as obtaining the names of files
or displaying characters using international fonts, the strings must be
translated into one or possibly multiple formats that the various system
calls can use. For instance, on a Japanese Unix workstation, a user
might obtain a filename represented in the EUC-JP file encoding and then
translate the characters to the jisx0208 font encoding in order to
display the filename in a Tk widget. The purpose of the encoding package
is to help bridge the translation gap. UTF-8 provides an intermediate
staging ground for all the various encodings. In the example above, text
would be translated into UTF-8 from whatever file encoding the operating
system is using. Then it would be translated from UTF-8 into whatever
font encoding the display routines require.</p>
<p>Some basic encodings are compiled into Tcl. Others can be defined by
the user or dynamically loaded from encoding files in a
platform-independent manner.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong> finds an encoding given its
<em>name</em>. The name may refer to a built-in Tcl encoding, a
user-defined encoding registered by calling
<strong>Tcl_CreateEncoding</strong>, or a dynamically-loadable encoding
file. The return value is a token that represents the encoding and can
be used in subsequent calls to procedures such as
<strong>Tcl_GetEncodingName</strong>, <strong>Tcl_FreeEncoding</strong>,
and <strong>Tcl_UtfToExternal</strong>. If the name did not refer to any
known or loadable encoding, NULL is returned and an error message is
returned in <em>interp</em>.</p>
<p>The encoding package maintains a database of all encodings currently
in use. The first time <em>name</em> is seen,
<strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong> returns an encoding with a reference
count of 1. If the same <em>name</em> is requested further times, then
the reference count for that encoding is incremented without the
overhead of allocating a new encoding and all its associated data
structures.</p>
<p>When an <em>encoding</em> is no longer needed,
<strong>Tcl_FreeEncoding</strong> should be called to release it. When
an <em>encoding</em> is no longer in use anywhere (i.e., it has been
freed as many times as it has been gotten)
<strong>Tcl_FreeEncoding</strong> will release all storage the encoding
was using and delete it from the database.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetEncodingFromObj</strong> treats the string
representation of <em>objPtr</em> as an encoding name, and finds an
encoding with that name, just as <strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong> does.
When an encoding is found, it is cached within the
<strong>objPtr</strong> value for future reference, the
<strong>Tcl_Encoding</strong> token is written to the storage pointed to
by <em>encodingPtr</em>, and the value <strong>TCL_OK</strong> is
returned. If no such encoding is found, the value
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned, and no writing to
<strong>*</strong><em>encodingPtr</em> takes place. Just as with
<strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong>, the caller should call
<strong>Tcl_FreeEncoding</strong> on the resulting encoding token when
that token will no longer be used.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString</strong> converts a source buffer
<em>src</em> from the specified <em>encoding</em> into UTF-8. The
converted bytes are stored in <em>dstPtr</em>, which is then
null-terminated. The caller should eventually call
<strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong> to free any information stored in
<em>dstPtr</em>. When converting, if any of the characters in the source
buffer cannot be represented in the target encoding, a default fallback
character will be used. The return value is a pointer to the value
stored in the DString.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</strong> converts a source buffer
<em>src</em> from the specified <em>encoding</em> into UTF-8. Up to
<em>srcLen</em> bytes are converted from the source buffer and up to
<em>dstLen</em> converted bytes are stored in <em>dst</em>. In all
cases, <em>*srcReadPtr</em> is filled with the number of bytes that were
successfully converted from <em>src</em> and <em>*dstWrotePtr</em> is
filled with the corresponding number of bytes that were stored in
<em>dst</em>. The return value is one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>TCL_OK</dt>
<dd>
<p>All bytes of <em>src</em> were converted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_CONVERT_NOSPACE</dt>
<dd>
<p>The destination buffer was not large enough for all of the converted
data; as many characters as could fit were converted though.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_CONVERT_MULTIBYTE</dt>
<dd>
<p>The last few bytes in the source buffer were the beginning of a
multibyte sequence, but more bytes were needed to complete this
sequence. A subsequent call to the conversion routine should pass a
buffer containing the unconverted bytes that remained in <em>src</em>
plus some further bytes from the source stream to properly convert the
formerly split-up multibyte sequence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_CONVERT_SYNTAX</dt>
<dd>
<p>The source buffer contained an invalid character sequence. This may
occur if the input stream has been damaged or if the input encoding
method was misidentified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCL_CONVERT_UNKNOWN</dt>
<dd>
<p>The source buffer contained a character that could not be represented
in the target encoding and <strong>TCL_ENCODING_STOPONERROR</strong> was
specified.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tcl_UtfToExternalDString</strong> converts a source buffer
<em>src</em> from UTF-8 into the specified <em>encoding</em>. The
converted bytes are stored in <em>dstPtr</em>, which is then terminated
with the appropriate encoding-specific null. The caller should
eventually call <strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong> to free any information
stored in <em>dstPtr</em>. When converting, if any of the characters in
the source buffer cannot be represented in the target encoding, a
default fallback character will be used. The return value is a pointer
to the value stored in the DString.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_UtfToExternal</strong> converts a source buffer
<em>src</em> from UTF-8 into the specified <em>encoding</em>. Up to
<em>srcLen</em> bytes are converted from the source buffer and up to
<em>dstLen</em> converted bytes are stored in <em>dst</em>. In all
cases, <em>*srcReadPtr</em> is filled with the number of bytes that were
successfully converted from <em>src</em> and <em>*dstWrotePtr</em> is
filled with the corresponding number of bytes that were stored in
<em>dst</em>. The return values are the same as the return values for
<strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_WinUtfToTChar</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_WinTCharToUtf</strong> are Windows-only convenience
functions for converting between UTF-8 and Windows strings based on the
TCHAR type which is by convention a Unicode character on Windows NT.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetEncodingName</strong> is roughly the inverse of
<strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong>. Given an <em>encoding</em>, the return
value is the <em>name</em> argument that was used to create the
encoding. The string returned by <strong>Tcl_GetEncodingName</strong> is
only guaranteed to persist until the <em>encoding</em> is deleted. The
caller must not modify this string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetSystemEncoding</strong> sets the default encoding that
should be used whenever the user passes a NULL value for the
<em>encoding</em> argument to any of the other encoding functions. If
<em>name</em> is NULL, the system encoding is reset to the default
system encoding, <strong>binary</strong>. If the name did not refer to
any known or loadable encoding, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned
and an error message is left in <em>interp</em>. Otherwise, this
procedure increments the reference count of the new system encoding,
decrements the reference count of the old system encoding, and returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetEncodingNameFromEnvironment</strong> provides a means
for the Tcl library to report the encoding name it believes to be the
correct one to use as the system encoding, based on system calls and
examination of the environment suitable for the platform. It accepts
<em>bufPtr</em>, a pointer to an uninitialized or freed
<strong>Tcl_DString</strong> and writes the encoding name to it. The
<strong>Tcl_DStringValue</strong> is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetEncodingNames</strong> sets the <em>interp</em> result
to a list consisting of the names of all the encodings that are
currently defined or can be dynamically loaded, searching the encoding
path specified by <strong>Tcl_SetDefaultEncodingDir</strong>. This
procedure does not ensure that the dynamically-loadable encoding files
contain valid data, but merely that they exist.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateEncoding</strong> defines a new encoding and
registers the C procedures that are called back to convert between the
encoding and UTF-8. Encodings created by
<strong>Tcl_CreateEncoding</strong> are thereafter visible in the
database used by <strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong>. Just as with the
<strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong> procedure, the return value is a token
that represents the encoding and can be used in subsequent calls to
other encoding functions. <strong>Tcl_CreateEncoding</strong> returns an
encoding with a reference count of 1. If an encoding with the specified
<em>name</em> already exists, then its entry in the database is replaced
with the new encoding; the token for the old encoding will remain valid
and continue to behave as before, but users of the new token will now
call the new encoding procedures.</p>
<p>The <em>typePtr</em> argument to <strong>Tcl_CreateEncoding</strong>
contains information about the name of the encoding and the procedures
that will be called to convert between this encoding and UTF-8. It is
defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tcl_EncodingType {
    const char *encodingName;
    Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *toUtfProc;
    Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *fromUtfProc;
    Tcl_EncodingFreeProc *freeProc;
    ClientData clientData;
    int nullSize;
} Tcl_EncodingType;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>encodingName</em> provides a string name for the encoding, by
which it can be referred in other procedures such as
<strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong>. The <em>toUtfProc</em> refers to a
callback procedure to invoke to convert text from this encoding into
UTF-8. The <em>fromUtfProc</em> refers to a callback procedure to invoke
to convert text from UTF-8 into this encoding. The <em>freeProc</em>
refers to a callback procedure to invoke when this encoding is deleted.
The <em>freeProc</em> field may be NULL. The <em>clientData</em>
contains an arbitrary one-word value passed to <em>toUtfProc</em>,
<em>fromUtfProc</em>, and <em>freeProc</em> whenever they are called.
Typically, this is a pointer to a data structure containing
encoding-specific information that can be used by the callback
procedures. For instance, two very similar encodings such as
<strong>ascii</strong> and <strong>macRoman</strong> may use the same
callback procedure, but use different values of <em>clientData</em> to
control its behavior. The <em>nullSize</em> specifies the number of zero
bytes that signify end-of-string in this encoding. It must be
<strong>1</strong> (for single-byte or multi-byte encodings like ASCII
or Shift-JIS) or <strong>2</strong> (for double-byte encodings like
Unicode). Constant-sized encodings with 3 or more bytes per character
(such as CNS11643) are not accepted.</p>
<p>The callback procedures <em>toUtfProc</em> and <em>fromUtfProc</em>
should match the type <strong>Tcl_EncodingConvertProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_EncodingConvertProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        const char *src,
        int srcLen,
        int flags,
        Tcl_EncodingState *statePtr,
        char *dst,
        int dstLen,
        int *srcReadPtr,
        int *dstWrotePtr,
        int *dstCharsPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>toUtfProc</em> and <em>fromUtfProc</em> procedures are called
by the <strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_UtfToExternal</strong> family of functions to perform the
actual conversion. The <em>clientData</em> parameter to these procedures
is the same as the <em>clientData</em> field specified to
<strong>Tcl_CreateEncoding</strong> when the encoding was created. The
remaining arguments to the callback procedures are the same as the
arguments, documented at the top, to <strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</strong>
or <strong>Tcl_UtfToExternal</strong>, with the following exceptions. If
the <em>srcLen</em> argument to one of those high-level functions is
negative, the value passed to the callback procedure will be the
appropriate encoding-specific string length of <em>src</em>. If any of
the <em>srcReadPtr</em>, <em>dstWrotePtr</em>, or <em>dstCharsPtr</em>
arguments to one of the high-level functions is NULL, the corresponding
value passed to the callback procedure will be a non-NULL location.</p>
<p>The callback procedure <em>freeProc</em>, if non-NULL, should match
the type <strong>Tcl_EncodingFreeProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_EncodingFreeProc(
        ClientData clientData);</code></pre>
<p>This <em>freeProc</em> function is called when the encoding is
deleted. The <em>clientData</em> parameter is the same as the
<em>clientData</em> field specified to
<strong>Tcl_CreateEncoding</strong> when the encoding was created.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</strong> are called to access and set
the list of filesystem directories searched for encoding data files.</p>
<p>The value returned by <strong>Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath</strong> is
the value stored by the last successful call to
<strong>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</strong>. If no calls to
<strong>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</strong> have occurred, Tcl will
compute an initial value based on the environment. There is one encoding
search path for the entire process, shared by all threads in the
process.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</strong> stores <em>searchPath</em>
and returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong>, unless <em>searchPath</em> is not a
valid Tcl list, which causes <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> to be returned.
The elements of <em>searchPath</em> are not verified as existing
readable filesystem directories. When searching for encoding data files
takes place, and non-existent or non-readable filesystem directories on
the <em>searchPath</em> are silently ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetDefaultEncodingDir</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetDefaultEncodingDir</strong> are obsolete interfaces best
replaced with calls to <strong>Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</strong>. They are called to access
and set the first element of the <em>searchPath</em> list. Since Tcl
searches <em>searchPath</em> for encoding data files in list order,
these routines establish the directory in which to find encoding data
files.</p>
<h1 id="encoding-files">ENCODING FILES</h1>
<p>Space would prohibit precompiling into Tcl every possible encoding
algorithm, so many encodings are stored on disk as dynamically-loadable
encoding files. This behavior also allows the user to create additional
encoding files that can be loaded using the same mechanism. These
encoding files contain information about the tables and/or escape
sequences used to map between an external encoding and Unicode. The
external encoding may consist of single-byte, multi-byte, or double-byte
characters.</p>
<p>Each dynamically-loadable encoding is represented as a text file. The
initial line of the file, beginning with a symbol, is a comment that
provides a human-readable description of the file. The next line
identifies the type of encoding file. It can be one of the following
letters:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1] S</dt>
<dd>
<p>A single-byte encoding, where one character is always one byte long
in the encoding. An example is <strong>iso8859-1</strong>, used by many
European languages.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2] D</dt>
<dd>
<p>A double-byte encoding, where one character is always two bytes long
in the encoding. An example is <strong>big5</strong>, used for Chinese
text.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3] M</dt>
<dd>
<p>A multi-byte encoding, where one character may be either one or two
bytes long. Certain bytes are lead bytes, indicating that another byte
must follow and that together the two bytes represent one character.
Other bytes are not lead bytes and represent themselves. An example is
<strong>shiftjis</strong>, used by many Japanese computers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4] E</dt>
<dd>
<p>An escape-sequence encoding, specifying that certain sequences of
bytes do not represent characters, but commands that describe how
following bytes should be interpreted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The rest of the lines in the file depend on the type.</p>
<p>Cases [1], [2], and [3] are collectively referred to as table-based
encoding files. The lines in a table-based encoding file are in the same
format as this example taken from the <strong>shiftjis</strong> encoding
(this is not the complete file):</p>

this encoding. The second number is a <strong>1</strong> if this file
represents the encoding for a symbol font, or <strong>0</strong>
otherwise. The last number (in base 10) is how many pages of data
follow.</p>
<p>Subsequent lines in the example above are pages that describe how to
map from the encoding into 2-byte Unicode. The first line in a page
identifies the page number. Following it are 256 double-byte numbers,
arranged as 16 rows of 16 numbers. Given a character in the encoding,
the high byte of that character is used to select which page, and the
low byte of that character is used as an index to select one of the
double-byte numbers in that page - the value obtained being the
corresponding Unicode character. By examination of the example above,
one can see that the characters 0x7E and 0x8163 in
<strong>shiftjis</strong> map to 203E and 2026 in Unicode,
respectively.</p>
<p>Following the first page will be all the other pages, each in the
same format as the first: one number identifying the page followed by
256 double-byte Unicode characters. If a character in the encoding maps
to the Unicode character 0000, it means that the character does not
actually exist. If all characters on a page would map to 0000, that page
can be omitted.</p>
<p>Case [4] is the escape-sequence encoding file. The lines in an this
type of file are in the same format as this example taken from the
<strong>iso2022-jp</strong> encoding:</p>
<pre><code># Encoding file: iso2022-jp, escape-driven
E
init        {}
final       {}
iso8859-1   \x1b(B
jis0201     \x1b(J
jis0208     \x1b$@
jis0208     \x1b$B
jis0212     \x1b$(D
gb2312      \x1b$A
ksc5601     \x1b$(C</code></pre>
<p>In the file, the first column represents an option and the second
column is the associated value. <strong>init</strong> is a string to
emit or expect before the first character is converted, while
<strong>final</strong> is a string to emit or expect after the last
character. All other options are names of table-based encodings; the
associated value is the escape-sequence that marks that encoding. Tcl
syntax is used for the values; in the above example, for instance,
represents the empty string and represents character 27.</p>
<p>When <strong>Tcl_GetEncoding</strong> encounters an encoding
<em>name</em> that has not been loaded, it attempts to load an encoding
file called <em>name</em><strong>.enc</strong> from the
<strong>encoding</strong> subdirectory of each directory that Tcl
searches for its script library. If the encoding file exists, but is
malformed, an error message will be left in <em>interp</em>.</p>
