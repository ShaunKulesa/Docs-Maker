<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

Tcl_SplitPath(path, argcPtr, argvPtr)

Tcl_JoinPath(argc, argv, resultPtr)

Tcl_PathType
Tcl_GetPathType(path)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>File path in a form appropriate for the current platform (see the
<strong>filename</strong> manual entry for acceptable forms for path
names).</p>
<p>Filled in with number of path elements in <em>path</em>.</p>
<p><em>*argvPtr</em> will be filled in with the address of an array of
pointers to the strings that are the extracted elements of
<em>path</em>. There will be <em>*argcPtr</em> valid entries in the
array, followed by a NULL entry.</p>
<p>Number of elements in <em>argv</em>.</p>
<p>Array of path elements to merge together into a single path.</p>
<p>A pointer to an initialized <strong>Tcl_DString</strong> to which the
result of <strong>Tcl_JoinPath</strong> will be appended.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures have been superseded by the Tcl-value-aware
procedures in the <strong>FileSystem</strong> man page, which are more
efficient.</p>
<p>These procedures may be used to disassemble and reassemble file paths
in a platform independent manner: they provide C-level access to the
same functionality as the <strong>file split</strong>, <strong>file
join</strong>, and <strong>file pathtype</strong> commands.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SplitPath</strong> breaks a path into its constituent
elements, returning an array of pointers to the elements using
<em>argcPtr</em> and <em>argvPtr</em>. The area of memory pointed to by
<em>*argvPtr</em> is dynamically allocated; in addition to the array of
pointers, it also holds copies of all the path elements. It is the
caller's responsibility to free all of this storage. For example,
suppose that you have called <strong>Tcl_SplitPath</strong> with the
following code:</p>
<pre><code>int argc;
char *path;
char **argv;
...
Tcl_SplitPath(string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);</code></pre>
<p>Then you should eventually free the storage with a call like the
following:</p>
<pre><code>Tcl_Free((char *) argv);</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tcl_JoinPath</strong> is the inverse of
<strong>Tcl_SplitPath</strong>: it takes a collection of path elements
given by <em>argc</em> and <em>argv</em> and generates a result string
that is a properly constructed path. The result string is appended to
<em>resultPtr</em>. <em>ResultPtr</em> must refer to an initialized
<strong>Tcl_DString</strong>.</p>
<p>If the result of <strong>Tcl_SplitPath</strong> is passed to
<strong>Tcl_JoinPath</strong>, the result will refer to the same
location, but may not be in the same form. This is because
<strong>Tcl_SplitPath</strong> and <strong>Tcl_JoinPath</strong>
eliminate duplicate path separators and return a normalized form for
each platform.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetPathType</strong> returns the type of the specified
<em>path</em>, where <strong>Tcl_PathType</strong> is one of
<strong>TCL_PATH_ABSOLUTE</strong>, <strong>TCL_PATH_RELATIVE</strong>,
or <strong>TCL_PATH_VOLUME_RELATIVE</strong>. See the
<strong>filename</strong> manual entry for a description of the path
types for each platform.</p>
