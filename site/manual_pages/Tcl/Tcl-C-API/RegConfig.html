<p>Tcl_RegisterConfig - procedures to register embedded configuration
information</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

void
Tcl_RegisterConfig(interp, pkgName, configuration, valEncoding)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Refers to the interpreter the embedded configuration information is
registered for. Must not be NULL.</p>
<p>Contains the name of the package registering the embedded
configuration as ASCII string. This means that this information is in
UTF-8 too. Must not be NULL.</p>
<p>Refers to an array of Tcl_Config entries containing the information
embedded in the binary library. Must not be NULL. The end of the array
is signaled by either a key identical to NULL, or a key referring to the
empty string.</p>
<p>Contains the name of the encoding used to store the configuration
values as ASCII string. This means that this information is in UTF-8
too. Must not be NULL.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The function described here has its base in TIP 59 and provides
extensions with support for the embedding of configuration information
into their binary library and the generation of a Tcl-level interface
for querying this information.</p>
<p>To embed configuration information into their binary library an
extension has to define a non-volatile array of Tcl_Config entries in
one if its source files and then call
<strong>Tcl_RegisterConfig</strong> to register that information.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_RegisterConfig</strong> takes four arguments; first, a
reference to the interpreter we are registering the information with,
second, the name of the package registering its configuration
information, third, a pointer to an array of structures, and fourth a
string declaring the encoding used by the configuration values.</p>
<p>The string <em>valEncoding</em> contains the name of an encoding
known to Tcl. All these names are use only characters in the ASCII
subset of UTF-8 and are thus implicitly in the UTF-8 encoding. It is
expected that keys are legible English text and therefore using the
ASCII subset of UTF-8. In other words, they are expected to be in UTF-8
too. The values associated with the keys can be any string however. For
these the contents of <em>valEncoding</em> define which encoding was
used to represent the characters of the strings.</p>
<p>Each element of the <em>configuration</em> array refers to two
strings containing the key and the value associated with that key. The
end of the array is signaled by either an empty key or a key identical
to NULL. The function makes <strong>no</strong> copy of the
<em>configuration</em> array. This means that the caller has to make
sure that the memory holding this array is never released. This is the
meaning behind the word <strong>non-volatile</strong> used earlier. The
easiest way to accomplish this is to define a global static array of
Tcl_Config entries. See the file in the sources of the Tcl core for an
example.</p>
<p>When called <strong>Tcl_RegisterConfig</strong> will</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>create a namespace having the provided <em>pkgName</em>, if not
yet existing.</p></li>
<li><p>create the command <strong>pkgconfig</strong> in that namespace
and link it to the provided information so that the keys from
<em>configuration</em> and their associated values can be retrieved
through calls to <strong>pkgconfig</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The command <strong>pkgconfig</strong> will provide two subcommands,
<strong>list</strong> and <strong>get</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>::<em>pkgName</em>::<strong>pkgconfig</strong> list</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list containing the names of all defined keys.</p>
</dd>
<dt>::<em>pkgName</em>::<strong>pkgconfig</strong> get <em>key</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the configuration value associated with the specified
<em>key</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
