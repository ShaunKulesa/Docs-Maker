<p>Tcl_SubstObj - perform substitutions on Tcl values</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

Tcl_Obj *
Tcl_SubstObj(interp, objPtr, flags)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter in which to execute Tcl scripts and lookup variables. If
an error occurs, the interpreter's result is modified to hold an error
message.</p>
<p>A Tcl value containing the string to perform substitutions on.</p>
<p>ORed combination of flag bits that specify which substitutions to
perform. The flags <strong>TCL_SUBST_COMMANDS</strong>,
<strong>TCL_SUBST_VARIABLES</strong> and
<strong>TCL_SUBST_BACKSLASHES</strong> are currently supported, and
<strong>TCL_SUBST_ALL</strong> is provided as a convenience for the
common case where all substitutions are desired.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_SubstObj</strong> function is used to perform
substitutions on strings in the fashion of the <strong>subst</strong>
command. It gets the value of the string contained in <em>objPtr</em>
and scans it, copying characters and performing the chosen substitutions
as it goes to an output value which is returned as the result of the
function. In the event of an error occurring during the execution of a
command or variable substitution, the function returns NULL and an error
message is left in <em>interp</em>'s result.</p>
<p>Three kinds of substitutions are supported. When the
<strong>TCL_SUBST_BACKSLASHES</strong> bit is set in <em>flags</em>,
sequences that look like backslash substitutions for Tcl commands are
replaced by their corresponding character.</p>
<p>When the <strong>TCL_SUBST_VARIABLES</strong> bit is set in
<em>flags</em>, sequences that look like variable substitutions for Tcl
commands are replaced by the contents of the named variable.</p>
<p>When the <strong>TCL_SUBST_COMMANDS</strong> bit is set in
<em>flags</em>, sequences that look like command substitutions for Tcl
commands are replaced by the result of evaluating that script. Where an
uncaught occurs during the evaluation of a command substitution, an
empty string is substituted for the command. Where an uncaught occurs
during the evaluation of a command substitution, the result of the whole
substitution on <em>objPtr</em> will be truncated at the point
immediately before the start of the command substitution, and no
characters will be added to the result or substitutions performed after
that point.</p>
