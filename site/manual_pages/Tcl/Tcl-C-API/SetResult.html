<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The procedures described here are utilities for manipulating the
result value in a Tcl interpreter. The interpreter result may be either
a Tcl value or a string. For example, <strong>Tcl_SetObjResult</strong>
and <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> set the interpreter result to,
respectively, a value and a string. Similarly,
<strong>Tcl_GetObjResult</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GetStringResult</strong> return the interpreter result as a
value and as a string. The procedures always keep the string and value
forms of the interpreter result consistent. For example, if
<strong>Tcl_SetObjResult</strong> is called to set the result to a
value, then <strong>Tcl_GetStringResult</strong> is called, it will
return the value's string representation.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetObjResult</strong> arranges for <em>objPtr</em> to be
the result for <em>interp</em>, replacing any existing result. The
result is left pointing to the value referenced by <em>objPtr</em>.
<em>objPtr</em>'s reference count is incremented since there is now a
new reference to it from <em>interp</em>. The reference count for any
old result value is decremented and the old result value is freed if no
references to it remain.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetObjResult</strong> returns the result for
<em>interp</em> as a value. The value's reference count is not
incremented; if the caller needs to retain a long-term pointer to the
value they should use <strong>Tcl_IncrRefCount</strong> to increment its
reference count in order to keep it from being freed too early or
accidentally changed.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> arranges for <em>result</em> to be the
result for the current Tcl command in <em>interp</em>, replacing any
existing result. The <em>freeProc</em> argument specifies how to manage
the storage for the <em>result</em> argument; it is discussed in the
section <strong>THE TCL_FREEPROC ARGUMENT TO TCL_SETRESULT</strong>
below. If <em>result</em> is <strong>NULL</strong>, then
<em>freeProc</em> is ignored and <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong>
re-initializes <em>interp</em>'s result to point to an empty string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetStringResult</strong> returns the result for
<em>interp</em> as a string. If the result was set to a value by a
<strong>Tcl_SetObjResult</strong> call, the value form will be converted
to a string and returned. If the value's string representation contains
null bytes, this conversion will lose information. For this reason,
programmers are encouraged to write their code to use the new value API
procedures and to call <strong>Tcl_GetObjResult</strong> instead.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ResetResult</strong> clears the result for
<em>interp</em> and leaves the result in its normal empty initialized
state. If the result is a value, its reference count is decremented and
the result is left pointing to an unshared value representing an empty
string. If the result is a dynamically allocated string, its memory is
free*d and the result is left as a empty string.
<strong>Tcl_ResetResult</strong> also clears the error state managed by
<strong>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</strong>, <strong>Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo</strong>,
and <strong>Tcl_SetErrorCode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AppendResult</strong> makes it easy to build up Tcl
results in pieces. It takes each of its <em>result</em> arguments and
appends them in order to the current result associated with
<em>interp</em>. If the result is in its initialized empty state (e.g.Â a
command procedure was just invoked or <strong>Tcl_ResetResult</strong>
was just called), then <strong>Tcl_AppendResult</strong> sets the result
to the concatenation of its <em>result</em> arguments.
<strong>Tcl_AppendResult</strong> may be called repeatedly as additional
pieces of the result are produced. <strong>Tcl_AppendResult</strong>
takes care of all the storage management issues associated with managing
<em>interp</em>'s result, such as allocating a larger result area if
necessary. It also manages conversion to and from the <em>result</em>
field of the <em>interp</em> so as to handle backward-compatibility with
old-style extensions. Any number of <em>result</em> arguments may be
passed in a single call; the last argument in the list must be a NULL
pointer.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AppendResultVA</strong> is the same as
<strong>Tcl_AppendResult</strong> except that instead of taking a
variable number of arguments it takes an argument list.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_TransferResult</strong> transfers interpreter state from
<em>sourceInterp</em> to <em>targetInterp</em>. The two interpreters
must have been created in the same thread. If <em>sourceInterp</em> and
<em>targetInterp</em> are the same, nothing is done. Otherwise,
<strong>Tcl_TransferResult</strong> moves the result from
<em>sourceInterp</em> to <em>targetInterp</em>, and resets the result in
<em>sourceInterp</em>. It also moves the return options dictionary as
controlled by the return code value <em>code</em> in the same manner as
<strong>Tcl_GetReturnOptions</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="deprecated-interfaces">DEPRECATED INTERFACES</h1>
<h2 id="old-string-procedures">OLD STRING PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>Use of the following procedures is deprecated since they manipulate
the Tcl result as a string. Procedures such as
<strong>Tcl_SetObjResult</strong> that manipulate the result as a value
can be significantly more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AppendElement</strong> is similar to
<strong>Tcl_AppendResult</strong> in that it allows results to be built
up in pieces. However, <strong>Tcl_AppendElement</strong> takes only a
single <em>element</em> argument and it appends that argument to the
current result as a proper Tcl list element.
<strong>Tcl_AppendElement</strong> adds backslashes or braces if
necessary to ensure that <em>interp</em>'s result can be parsed as a
list and that <em>element</em> will be extracted as a single element.
Under normal conditions, <strong>Tcl_AppendElement</strong> will add a
space character to <em>interp</em>'s result just before adding the new
list element, so that the list elements in the result are properly
separated. However if the new list element is the first in a list or
sub-list (i.e. <em>interp</em>'s current result is empty, or consists of
the single character or ends in the characters then no space is
added.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FreeResult</strong> performs part of the work of
<strong>Tcl_ResetResult</strong>. It frees up the memory associated with
<em>interp</em>'s result. It also sets <em>interp-&gt;freeProc</em> to
zero, but does not change <em>interp-&gt;result</em> or clear error
state. <strong>Tcl_FreeResult</strong> is most commonly used when a
procedure is about to replace one result value with another.</p>
<h2 id="direct-access-to-interp-result">DIRECT ACCESS TO
INTERP-&gt;RESULT</h2>
<p>It used to be legal for programs to directly read and write
<em>interp-&gt;result</em> to manipulate the interpreter result. The Tcl
headers no longer permit this access by default, and C code still doing
this must be updated to use supported routines
<strong>Tcl_GetObjResult</strong>, <strong>Tcl_GetStringResult</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_SetObjResult</strong>, and <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong>.
As a migration aid, access can be restored with the compiler
directive</p>
<pre><code>#define USE_INTERP_RESULT</code></pre>
<p>but this is meant only to offer life support to otherwise dead
code.</p>
<h1 id="the-tcl_freeproc-argument-to-tcl_setresult">THE TCL_FREEPROC
ARGUMENT TO TCL_SETRESULT</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong>'s <em>freeProc</em> argument specifies
how the Tcl system is to manage the storage for the <em>result</em>
argument. If <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_SetObjResult</strong> are called at a time when
<em>interp</em> holds a string result, they do whatever is necessary to
dispose of the old string result (see the <strong>Tcl_Interp</strong>
manual entry for details on this).</p>
<p>If <em>freeProc</em> is <strong>TCL_STATIC</strong> it means that
<em>result</em> refers to an area of static storage that is guaranteed
not to be modified until at least the next call to
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>. If <em>freeProc</em> is
<strong>TCL_DYNAMIC</strong> it means that <em>result</em> was allocated
with a call to <strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong> and is now the property of the
Tcl system. <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> will arrange for the string's
storage to be released by calling <strong>Tcl_Free</strong> when it is
no longer needed. If <em>freeProc</em> is <strong>TCL_VOLATILE</strong>
it means that <em>result</em> points to an area of memory that is likely
to be overwritten when <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> returns (e.g.Â it
points to something in a stack frame). In this case
<strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> will make a copy of the string in
dynamically allocated storage and arrange for the copy to be the result
for the current Tcl command.</p>
<p>If <em>freeProc</em> is not one of the values
<strong>TCL_STATIC</strong>, <strong>TCL_DYNAMIC</strong>, and
<strong>TCL_VOLATILE</strong>, then it is the address of a procedure
that Tcl should call to free the string. This allows applications to use
non-standard storage allocators. When Tcl no longer needs the storage
for the string, it will call <em>freeProc</em>. <em>FreeProc</em> should
have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tcl_FreeProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(
        char *blockPtr);</code></pre>
<p>When <em>freeProc</em> is called, its <em>blockPtr</em> will be set
to the value of <em>result</em> passed to
<strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong>.</p>
