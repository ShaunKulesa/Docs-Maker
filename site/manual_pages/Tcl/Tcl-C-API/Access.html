<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tcl_Access, Tcl_Stat - check file permissions and other
attributes</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

int
Tcl_Access(path, mode)

int
Tcl_Stat(path, statPtr)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Native name of the file to check the attributes of.</p>
<p>Mask consisting of one or more of <strong>R_OK</strong>,
<strong>W_OK</strong>, <strong>X_OK</strong> and <strong>F_OK</strong>.
<strong>R_OK</strong>, <strong>W_OK</strong> and <strong>X_OK</strong>
request checking whether the file exists and has read, write and execute
permissions, respectively. <strong>F_OK</strong> just requests a check
for the existence of the file.</p>
<p>The structure that contains the result.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based APIs <strong>Tcl_FSAccess</strong>
and <strong>Tcl_FSStat</strong> should be used in preference to
<strong>Tcl_Access</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Stat</strong>, wherever
possible. Those functions also support Tcl's virtual filesystem layer,
which these do not.</p>
<h2 id="obsolete-functions">OBSOLETE FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>There are two reasons for calling <strong>Tcl_Access</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_Stat</strong> rather than calling system level functions
<strong>access</strong> and <strong>stat</strong> directly. First, the
Windows implementation of both functions fixes some bugs in the system
level calls. Second, both <strong>Tcl_Access</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_Stat</strong> (as well as
<strong>Tcl_OpenFileChannelProc</strong>) hook into a linked list of
functions. This allows the possibility to reroute file access to
alternative media or access methods.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Access</strong> checks whether the process would be
allowed to read, write or test for existence of the file (or other file
system object) whose name is <em>path</em>. If <em>path</em> is a
symbolic link on Unix, then permissions of the file referred by this
symbolic link are tested.</p>
<p>On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is returned. On
error (at least one bit in mode asked for a permission that is denied,
or some other error occurred), -1 is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Stat</strong> fills the stat structure <em>statPtr</em>
with information about the specified file. You do not need any access
rights to the file to get this information but you need search rights to
all directories named in the path leading to the file. The stat
structure includes info regarding device, inode (always 0 on Windows),
privilege mode, nlink (always 1 on Windows), user id (always 0 on
Windows), group id (always 0 on Windows), rdev (same as device on
Windows), size, last access time, last modification time, and creation
time.</p>
<p>If <em>path</em> exists, <strong>Tcl_Stat</strong> returns 0 and the
stat structure is filled with data. Otherwise, -1 is returned, and no
stat info is given.</p>
