<p>Array of strings to concatenate. Must have <em>argc</em> entries.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_Concat</strong> is a utility procedure used by several of
the Tcl commands. Given a collection of strings, it concatenates them
together into a single string, with the original strings separated by
spaces. This procedure behaves differently than
<strong>Tcl_Merge</strong>, in that the arguments are simply
concatenated: no effort is made to ensure proper list structure.
However, in most common usage the arguments will all be proper lists
themselves; if this is true, then the result will also have proper list
structure.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Concat</strong> eliminates leading and trailing white
space as it copies strings from <strong>argv</strong> to the result. If
an element of <strong>argv</strong> consists of nothing but white space,
then that string is ignored entirely. This white-space removal was added
to make the output of the <strong>concat</strong> command
cleaner-looking.</p>
<p>The result string is dynamically allocated using
<strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>; the caller must eventually release the space
by calling <strong>Tcl_Free</strong>.</p>
