<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>The first command-line argument to the program, which gives the
application's name.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_FindExecutable</strong> procedure computes the full
path name of the executable file from which the application was invoked
and saves it for Tcl's internal use. The executable's path name is
needed for several purposes in Tcl. For example, it is needed on some
platforms in the implementation of the <strong>load</strong> command. It
is also returned by the <strong>info nameofexecutable</strong>
command.</p>
<p>On UNIX platforms this procedure is typically invoked as the very
first thing in the application's main program; it must be passed
<em>argv[0]</em> as its argument. It is important not to change the
working directory before the invocation.
<strong>Tcl_FindExecutable</strong> uses <em>argv0</em> along with the
<strong>PATH</strong> environment variable to find the application's
executable, if possible. If it fails to find the binary, then future
calls to <strong>info nameofexecutable</strong> will return an empty
string.</p>
<p>On Windows platforms this procedure is typically invoked as the very
first thing in the application's main program as well; Its
<em>argv[0]</em> argument is only used to indicate whether the
executable has a stderr channel (any non-null value) or not (the value
null). If <strong>Tcl_SetPanicProc</strong> is never called and no
debugger is running, this determines whether the panic message is sent
to stderr or to a standard system dialog.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable</strong> simply returns a pointer to
the internal full path name of the executable file as computed by
<strong>Tcl_FindExecutable</strong>. This procedure call is the C API
equivalent to the <strong>info nameofexecutable</strong> command. NULL
is returned if the internal full path name has not been computed or
unknown.</p>
