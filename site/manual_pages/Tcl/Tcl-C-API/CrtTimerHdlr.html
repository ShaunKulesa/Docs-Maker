<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>How many milliseconds to wait before invoking <em>proc</em>.</p>
<p>Procedure to invoke after <em>milliseconds</em> have elapsed.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<p>Token for previously created timer handler (the return value from
some previous call to <strong>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</strong>).</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</strong> arranges for <em>proc</em> to
be invoked at a time <em>milliseconds</em> milliseconds in the future.
The callback to <em>proc</em> will be made by
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong>, so
<strong>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</strong> is only useful in programs that
dispatch events through <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or through Tcl
commands such as <strong>vwait</strong>. The call to <em>proc</em> may
not be made at the exact time given by <em>milliseconds</em>: it will be
made at the next opportunity after that time. For example, if
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> is not called until long after the time
has elapsed, or if there are other pending events to process before the
call to <em>proc</em>, then the call to <em>proc</em> will be
delayed.</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and return value that match the
type <strong>Tcl_TimerProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_TimerProc(
        ClientData clientData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to
<strong>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</strong> when the callback was created.
Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to a data structure containing
application-specific information about what to do in <em>proc</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler</strong> may be called to delete a
previously created timer handler. It deletes the handler indicated by
<em>token</em> so that no call to <em>proc</em> will be made; if that
handler no longer exists (e.g. because the time period has already
elapsed and <em>proc</em> has been invoked then
<strong>Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler</strong> does nothing. The tokens
returned by <strong>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</strong> never have a value
of NULL, so if NULL is passed to <strong>Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler</strong>
then the procedure does nothing.</p>
