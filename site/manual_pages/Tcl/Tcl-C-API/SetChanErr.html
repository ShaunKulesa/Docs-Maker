<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Refers to the Tcl channel whose bypass area is accessed.</p>
<p>Refers to the Tcl interpreter whose bypass area is accessed.</p>
<p>Error message put into a bypass area. A list of return options and
values, followed by a string message. Both message and the option/value
information are optional.</p>
<p>Reference to a place where the message stored in the accessed bypass
area can be stored in.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The current definition of a Tcl channel driver does not permit the
direct return of arbitrary error messages, except for the setting and
retrieval of channel options. All other functions are restricted to
POSIX error codes.</p>
<p>The functions described here overcome this limitation. Channel
drivers are allowed to use <strong>Tcl_SetChannelError</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetChannelErrorInterp</strong> to place arbitrary error
messages in <strong>bypass areas</strong> defined for channels and
interpreters. And the generic I/O layer uses
<strong>Tcl_GetChannelError</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GetChannelErrorInterp</strong> to look for messages in the
bypass areas and arrange for their return as errors. The POSIX error
codes set by a driver are used now if and only if no messages are
present.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetChannelError</strong> stores error information in the
bypass area of the specified channel. The number of references to the
<strong>msg</strong> value goes up by one. Previously stored information
will be discarded, by releasing the reference held by the channel. The
channel reference must not be NULL.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetChannelErrorInterp</strong> stores error information
in the bypass area of the specified interpreter. The number of
references to the <strong>msg</strong> value goes up by one. Previously
stored information will be discarded, by releasing the reference held by
the interpreter. The interpreter reference must not be NULL.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetChannelError</strong> places either the error message
held in the bypass area of the specified channel into <em>msgPtr</em>,
or NULL; and resets the bypass, that is, after an invocation all
following invocations will return NULL, until an intervening invocation
of <strong>Tcl_SetChannelError</strong> with a non-NULL message. The
<em>msgPtr</em> must not be NULL. The reference count of the message is
not touched. The reference previously held by the channel is now held by
the caller of the function and it is its responsibility to release that
reference when it is done with the value.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetChannelErrorInterp</strong> places either the error
message held in the bypass area of the specified interpreter into
<em>msgPtr</em>, or NULL; and resets the bypass, that is, after an
invocation all following invocations will return NULL, until an
intervening invocation of <strong>Tcl_SetChannelErrorInterp</strong>
with a non-NULL message. The <em>msgPtr</em> must not be NULL. The
reference count of the message is not touched. The reference previously
held by the interpreter is now held by the caller of the function and it
is its responsibility to release that reference when it is done with the
value.</p>
<p>Which functions of a channel driver are allowed to use which bypass
function is listed below, as is which functions of the public channel
API may leave a messages in the bypass areas.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tcl_DriverCloseProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>May use <strong>Tcl_SetChannelErrorInterp</strong>, and only this
function.</p>

<dt>Tcl_DriverWideSeekProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>May use <strong>Tcl_SetChannelError</strong>, and only this
function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Has already the ability to pass arbitrary error messages. Must
<em>not</em> use any of the new functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Has already the ability to pass arbitrary error messages. Must
<em>not</em> use any of the new functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tcl_DriverWatchProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Must <em>not</em> use any of the new functions. Is internally called
and has no ability to return any type of error whatsoever.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>May use <strong>Tcl_SetChannelError</strong>, and only this
function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Must <em>not</em> use any of the new functions. It is only a
low-level function, and not used by Tcl commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tcl_DriverHandlerProc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Must <em>not</em> use any of the new functions. Is internally called
and has no ability to return any type of error whatsoever.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Given the information above the following public functions of the Tcl
C API are affected by these changes; when these functions are called,
the channel may now contain a stored arbitrary error message requiring
processing by the caller.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Tcl_Flush   Tcl_GetsObj Tcl_Gets
Tcl_ReadChars   Tcl_ReadRaw Tcl_Read
Tcl_Seek    Tcl_StackChannel    Tcl_Tell
Tcl_WriteChars  Tcl_WriteObj    Tcl_WriteRaw
Tcl_Write</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>All other API functions are unchanged. In particular, the functions
below leave all their error information in the interpreter result.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Tcl_Close   Tcl_UnstackChannel  Tcl_UnregisterChannel</code></pre>
