<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_GetTime</strong> function retrieves the current time
as a <em>Tcl_Time</em> structure in memory the caller provides. This
structure has the following definition:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct Tcl_Time {
    long sec;
    long usec;
} Tcl_Time;</code></pre>
<p>On return, the <em>sec</em> member of the structure is filled in with
the number of seconds that have elapsed since the <em>epoch:</em> the
epoch is the point in time of 00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970. This number
does <em>not</em> count leap seconds - an interval of one day advances
it by 86400 seconds regardless of whether a leap second has been
inserted.</p>
<p>The <em>usec</em> member of the structure is filled in with the
number of microseconds that have elapsed since the start of the second
designated by <em>sec</em>. The Tcl library makes every effort to keep
this number as precise as possible, subject to the limitations of the
computer system. On multiprocessor variants of Windows, this number may
be limited to the 10- or 20-ms granularity of the system clock. (On
single-processor Windows systems, the <em>usec</em> field is derived
from a performance counter and is highly precise.)</p>
<h2 id="virtualized-time">VIRTUALIZED TIME</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_SetTimeProc</strong> function registers two related
handler functions with the core. The first handler function is a
replacement for <strong>Tcl_GetTime</strong>, or rather the OS access
made by <strong>Tcl_GetTime</strong>. The other handler function is used
by the Tcl notifier to convert wait/block times from the virtual domain
into real time.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_QueryTimeProc</strong> function returns the currently
registered handler functions. If no external handlers were set then this
will return the standard handlers accessing and processing the native
time of the OS. The arguments to the function are allowed to be NULL;
and any argument which is NULL is ignored and not set.</p>
<p>The signatures of the handler functions are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_GetTimeProc(
        Tcl_Time *timebuf,
        ClientData clientData);
typedef void Tcl_ScaleTimeProc(
        Tcl_Time *timebuf,
        ClientData clientData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>timebuf</em> fields contain the time to manipulate, and the
<em>clientData</em> fields contain a pointer supplied at the time the
handler functions were registered.</p>
<p>Any handler pair specified has to return data which is consistent
between them. In other words, setting one handler of the pair to
something assuming a 10-times slowdown, and the other handler of the
pair to something assuming a two-times slowdown is wrong and not
allowed.</p>
<p>The set handler functions are allowed to run the delivered time
backwards, however this should be avoided. We have to allow it as the
native time can run backwards as the user can fiddle with the system
time one way or other. Note that the insertion of the hooks will not
change the behavior of the Tcl core with regard to this situation, i.e.
the existing behavior is retained.</p>
