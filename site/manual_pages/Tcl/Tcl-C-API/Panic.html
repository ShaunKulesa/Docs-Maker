<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>When the Tcl library detects that its internal data structures are in
an inconsistent state, or that its C procedures have been called in a
manner inconsistent with their documentation, it calls
<strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> to display a message describing the error and
abort the process. The <em>format</em> argument is a format string
describing how to format the remaining arguments <em>arg</em> into an
error message, according to the same formatting rules used by the
<strong>printf</strong> family of functions. The same formatting rules
are also used by the built-in Tcl command <strong>format</strong>.</p>
<p>In a freshly loaded Tcl library, <strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> prints
the formatted error message to the standard error file of the process,
and then calls <strong>abort</strong> to terminate the process.
<strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> does not return. On Windows, when a debugger
is running, the formatted error message is sent to the debugger instead.
If the windows executable does not have a stderr channel
(e.g.Â <strong>wish.exe</strong>), then a system dialog box is used to
display the panic message.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetPanicProc</strong> may be used to modify the behavior
of <strong>Tcl_Panic</strong>. The <em>panicProc</em> argument should
match the type <strong>Tcl_PanicProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_PanicProc(
        const char *format,
        arg, arg,...);</code></pre>
<p>After <strong>Tcl_SetPanicProc</strong> returns, any future calls to
<strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> will call <em>panicProc</em>, passing along
the <em>format</em> and <em>arg</em> arguments. <em>panicProc</em>
should avoid making calls into the Tcl library, or into other libraries
that may call the Tcl library, since the original call to
<strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> indicates the Tcl library is not in a state
of reliable operation.</p>
<p>The typical use of <strong>Tcl_SetPanicProc</strong> arranges for the
error message to be displayed or reported in a manner more suitable for
the application or the platform.</p>
<p>Although the primary callers of <strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> are the
procedures of the Tcl library, <strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> is a public
function and may be called by any extension or application that wishes
to abort the process and have a panic message displayed the same way
that panic messages from Tcl will be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_PanicVA</strong> is the same as
<strong>Tcl_Panic</strong> except that instead of taking a variable
number of arguments it takes an argument list.</p>
