<p>One-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<p>Token for asynchronous event handler.</p>
<p>Tcl interpreter in which command was being evaluated when handler was

active.</p>
<p>Completion code from command that just completed in <em>interp</em>,
or 0 if <em>interp</em> is NULL.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures provide a safe mechanism for dealing with
asynchronous events such as signals. If an event such as a signal occurs
while a Tcl script is being evaluated then it is not safe to take any
substantive action to process the event. For example, it is not safe to
evaluate a Tcl script since the interpreter may already be in the middle
of evaluating a script; it may not even be safe to allocate memory,
since a memory allocation could have been in progress when the event
occurred. The only safe approach is to set a flag indicating that the
event occurred, then handle the event later when the world has returned
to a clean state, such as after the current Tcl command completes.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong>, <strong>Tcl_AsyncDelete</strong>,
and <strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> are thread sensitive. They access
and/or set a thread-specific data structure in the event of a core built
with <em>--enable-threads</em>. The token created by
<strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong> contains the needed thread information
it was called from so that calling
<strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong>(<em>token</em>) will only yield the
origin thread into the asynchronous handler.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong> creates an asynchronous handler and
returns a token for it. The asynchronous handler must be created before
any occurrences of the asynchronous event that it is intended to handle
(it is not safe to create a handler at the time of an event). When an
asynchronous event occurs the code that detects the event (such as a
signal handler) should call <strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong> with the
token for the handler. <strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong> will mark the
handler as ready to execute, but it will not invoke the handler
immediately. Tcl will call the <em>proc</em> associated with the handler
later, when the world is in a safe state, and <em>proc</em> can then
carry out the actions associated with the asynchronous event.
<em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tcl_AsyncProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_AsyncProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        int code);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> will be the same as the <em>clientData</em>
argument passed to <strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong> when the handler was
created. If <em>proc</em> is invoked just after a command has completed
execution in an interpreter, then <em>interp</em> will identify the
interpreter in which the command was evaluated and <em>code</em> will be
the completion code returned by that command. The command's result will
be present in the interpreter's result. When <em>proc</em> returns,
whatever it leaves in the interpreter's result will be returned as the
result of the command and the integer value returned by <em>proc</em>
will be used as the new completion code for the command.</p>
<p>It is also possible for <em>proc</em> to be invoked when no
interpreter is active. This can happen, for example, if an asynchronous
event occurs while the application is waiting for interactive input or
an X event. In this case <em>interp</em> will be NULL and <em>code</em>
will be 0, and the return value from <em>proc</em> will be ignored.</p>
<p>The procedure <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> is called to invoke
all of the handlers that are ready. The procedure
<strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> will return non-zero whenever any
asynchronous handlers are ready; it can be checked to avoid calls to
<strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> when there are no ready handlers. Tcl
calls <strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> after each command is evaluated
and calls <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> if needed. Applications may
also call <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> at interesting times for that
application. For example, Tcl's event handler calls
<strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> after each event and calls
<strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> if needed. The <em>interp</em> and
<em>code</em> arguments to <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> have the
same meaning as for <em>proc</em>: they identify the active interpreter,
if any, and the completion code from the command that just
completed.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AsyncDelete</strong> removes an asynchronous handler so
that its <em>proc</em> will never be invoked again. A handler can be
deleted even when ready, and it will still not be invoked.</p>
<p>If multiple handlers become active at the same time, the handlers are
invoked in the order they were created (oldest handler first). The
<em>code</em> and the interpreter's result for later handlers reflect
the values returned by earlier handlers, so that the most recently
created handler has last say about the interpreter's result and
completion code. If new handlers become ready while handlers are
executing, <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> will invoke them all; at
each point it invokes the highest-priority (oldest) ready handler,
repeating this over and over until there are no longer any ready
handlers.</p>
<h1 id="warning">WARNING</h1>
<p>It is almost always a bad idea for an asynchronous event handler to
modify the interpreter's result or return a code different from its
<em>code</em> argument. This sort of behavior can disrupt the execution
of scripts in subtle ways and result in bugs that are extremely
difficult to track down. If an asynchronous event handler needs to
evaluate Tcl scripts then it should first save the interpreter's state
by calling <strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong>, passing in the
<em>code</em> argument. When the asynchronous handler is finished it
should restore the interpreter's state by calling
<strong>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</strong>, and then returning the
<em>code</em> argument.</p>
