<p>Tcl_InitStubs - initialize the Tcl stubs mechanism</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

const char *
Tcl_InitStubs(interp, version, exact)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Tcl interpreter handle.</p>
<p>A version string consisting of one or more decimal numbers separated
by dots.</p>
<p>Non-zero means that only the particular version specified by
<em>version</em> is acceptable. Zero means that versions newer than
<em>version</em> are also acceptable as long as they have the same major
version number as <em>version</em>.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The Tcl stubs mechanism defines a way to dynamically bind extensions
to a particular Tcl implementation at run time. This provides two
significant benefits to Tcl users:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Extensions that use the stubs mechanism can be loaded into
multiple versions of Tcl without being recompiled or relinked.</p></li>
<li><p>Extensions that use the stubs mechanism can be dynamically loaded
into statically-linked Tcl applications.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The stubs mechanism accomplishes this by exporting function tables
that define an interface to the Tcl API. The extension then accesses the
Tcl API through offsets into the function table, so there are no direct
references to any of the Tcl library's symbols. This redirection is
transparent to the extension, so an extension writer can continue to use
all public Tcl functions as documented.</p>
<p>The stubs mechanism requires no changes to applications incorporating
Tcl interpreters. Only developers creating C-based Tcl extensions need
to take steps to use the stubs mechanism with their extensions.</p>
<p>Enabling the stubs mechanism for an extension requires the following
steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Call <strong>Tcl_InitStubs</strong> in the extension before
calling any other Tcl functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the <strong>USE_TCL_STUBS</strong> symbol. Typically, you
would include the <strong>-DUSE_TCL_STUBS</strong> flag when compiling
the extension.</p></li>
<li><p>Link the extension with the Tcl stubs library instead of the
standard Tcl library. For example, to use the Tcl 8.6 ABI on Unix
platforms, the library name is <em>libtclstub8.6.a</em>; on Windows
platforms, the library name is <em>tclstub86.lib</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the extension also requires the Tk API, it must also call
<strong>Tk_InitStubs</strong> to initialize the Tk stubs interface and
link with the Tk stubs libraries. See the <strong>Tk_InitStubs</strong>
page for more information.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_InitStubs</strong> attempts to initialize the stub table
pointers and ensure that the correct version of Tcl is loaded. In
addition to an interpreter handle, it accepts as arguments a version
number and a Boolean flag indicating whether the extension requires an
exact version match or not. If <em>exact</em> is 0, then the extension
is indicating that newer versions of Tcl are acceptable as long as they
have the same major version number as <em>version</em>; non-zero means
that only the specified <em>version</em> is acceptable.
<strong>Tcl_InitStubs</strong> returns a string containing the actual
version of Tcl satisfying the request, or NULL if the Tcl version is not
acceptable, does not support stubs, or any other error condition
occurred.</p>
