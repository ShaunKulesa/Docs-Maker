<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures may be used to disassemble and reassemble Tcl lists.
<strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong> breaks a list up into its constituent
elements, returning an array of pointers to the elements using
<em>argcPtr</em> and <em>argvPtr</em>. While extracting the arguments,
<strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong> obeys the usual rules for backslash
substitutions and braces. The area of memory pointed to by
<em>*argvPtr</em> is dynamically allocated; in addition to the array of
pointers, it also holds copies of all the list elements. It is the
caller's responsibility to free up all of this storage. For example,
suppose that you have called <strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong> with the
following code:</p>
<pre><code>int argc, code;
char *string;
char **argv;
...
code = Tcl_SplitList(interp, string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);</code></pre>
<p>Then you should eventually free the storage with a call like the
following:</p>
<pre><code>Tcl_Free((char *) argv);</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong> normally returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, which means the list was successfully parsed.
If there was a syntax error in <em>list</em>, then
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and the interpreter's result will
point to an error message describing the problem (if <em>interp</em> was
not NULL). If <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned then no memory is
allocated and <em>*argvPtr</em> is not modified.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Merge</strong> is the inverse of
<strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong>: it takes a collection of strings given
by <em>argc</em> and <em>argv</em> and generates a result string that
has proper list structure. This means that commands like
<strong>index</strong> may be used to extract the original elements
again. In addition, if the result of <strong>Tcl_Merge</strong> is
passed to <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>, it will be parsed into
<em>argc</em> words whose values will be the same as the <em>argv</em>
strings passed to <strong>Tcl_Merge</strong>. <strong>Tcl_Merge</strong>
will modify the list elements with braces and/or backslashes in order to
produce proper Tcl list structure. The result string is dynamically
allocated using <strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>; the caller must eventually
release the space using <strong>Tcl_Free</strong>.</p>
<p>If the result of <strong>Tcl_Merge</strong> is passed to
<strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong>, the elements returned by
<strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong> will be identical to those passed into
<strong>Tcl_Merge</strong>. However, the converse is not true: if
<strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong> is passed a given string, and the
resulting <em>argc</em> and <em>argv</em> are passed to
<strong>Tcl_Merge</strong>, the resulting string may not be the same as
the original string passed to <strong>Tcl_SplitList</strong>. This is
because <strong>Tcl_Merge</strong> may use backslashes and braces
differently than the original string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong> are the procedures that do all of
the real work of <strong>Tcl_Merge</strong>.
<strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong> scans its <em>src</em> argument and
determines how to use backslashes and braces when converting it to a
list element. It returns an overestimate of the number of characters
required to represent <em>src</em> as a list element, and it stores
information in <em>*flagsPtr</em> that is needed by
<strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong> is a companion procedure to
<strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong>. It does the actual work of converting
a string to a list element. Its <em>flags</em> argument must be the same
as the value returned by <strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong>.
<strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong> writes a proper list element to
memory starting at *<em>dst</em> and returns a count of the total number
of characters written, which will be no more than the result returned by
<strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong>. <strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong>
writes out only the actual list element without any leading or trailing
spaces: it is up to the caller to include spaces between adjacent list
elements.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong> uses one of two different
approaches to handle the special characters in <em>src</em>. Wherever
possible, it handles special characters by surrounding the string with
braces. This produces clean-looking output, but cannot be used in some
situations, such as when <em>src</em> contains unmatched braces. In
these situations, <strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong> handles special
characters by generating backslash sequences for them. The caller may
insist on the second approach by OR-ing the flag value returned by
<strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong> with
<strong>TCL_DONT_USE_BRACES</strong>. Although this will produce an
uglier result, it is useful in some special situations, such as when
<strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong> is being used to generate a portion
of an argument for a Tcl command. In this case, surrounding <em>src</em>
with curly braces would cause the command not to be parsed
correctly.</p>
<p>By default, <strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong> will use quoting in
its output to be sure the first character of an element is not the hash
character This is to be sure the first element of any list passed to
<strong>eval</strong> is not mis-parsed as the beginning of a comment.
When a list element is not the first element of a list, this quoting is
not necessary. When the caller can be sure that the element is not the
first element of a list, it can disable quoting of the leading hash
character by OR-ing the flag value returned by
<strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong> with
<strong>TCL_DONT_QUOTE_HASH</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ScanCountedElement</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_ConvertCountedElement</strong> are the same as
<strong>Tcl_ScanElement</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_ConvertElement</strong>, except the length of string
<em>src</em> is specified by the <em>length</em> argument, and the
string may contain embedded nulls.</p>
