<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Tcl interpreter in which to add commands.</p>
<p>For <strong>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory</strong>, name of the file to which
memory information will be written. For
<strong>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</strong>, name of the file from which the
call is being made (normally <strong>__FILE__</strong>).</p>
<p>Line number at which the call to
<strong>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</strong> is made (normally
<strong>__LINE__</strong>).</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These functions provide access to Tcl memory debugging information.
They are only functional when Tcl has been compiled with
<strong>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</strong> defined at compile-time. When
<strong>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</strong> is not defined, these functions are all
no-ops.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory</strong> will output a list of all
currently allocated memory to the specified file. The information output
for each allocated block of memory is: starting and ending addresses
(excluding guard zone), size, source file where <strong>ckalloc</strong>
was called to allocate the block and line number in that file. It is
especially useful to call <strong>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory</strong> after
the Tcl interpreter has been deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_InitMemory</strong> adds the Tcl <strong>memory</strong>
command to the interpreter given by <em>interp</em>.
<strong>Tcl_InitMemory</strong> is called by
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</strong> forces a validation of the
guard zones of all currently allocated blocks of memory. Normally
validation of a block occurs when its freed, unless full validation is
enabled, in which case validation of all blocks occurs when
<strong>ckalloc</strong> and <strong>ckfree</strong> are called. This
function forces the validation to occur at any point.</p>
