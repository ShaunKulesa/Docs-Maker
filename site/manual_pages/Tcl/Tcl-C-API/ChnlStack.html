<p>Interpreter for error reporting.</p>
<p>The new channel I/O procedures to use for <em>channel</em>.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to channel I/O procedures.</p>
<p>Conditions under which <em>channel</em> will be used: OR-ed
combination of <strong>TCL_READABLE</strong>,
<strong>TCL_WRITABLE</strong> and <strong>TCL_EXCEPTION</strong>. This
can be a subset of the operations currently allowed on
<em>channel</em>.</p>
<p>An existing Tcl channel such as returned by
<strong>Tcl_CreateChannel</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These functions are for use by extensions that add processing layers
to Tcl I/O channels. Examples include compression and encryption
modules. These functions transparently stack and unstack a new channel
on top of an existing one. Any number of channels can be stacked
together.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Tcl channel code was rewritten in 8.3.2 to
correct some problems with the previous implementation with regard to
stacked channels. Anyone using stacked channels or creating stacked
channel drivers should update to the new
<strong>TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2</strong> <strong>Tcl_ChannelType</strong>
structure. See <strong>Tcl_CreateChannel</strong> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_StackChannel</strong> stacks a new <em>channel</em> on an
existing channel with the same name that was registered for
<em>channel</em> by <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_StackChannel</strong> works by creating a new channel
structure and placing itself on top of the channel stack. EOL
translation, encoding and buffering options are shared between all
channels in the stack. The hidden channel does no buffering, newline
translations, or character set encoding. Instead, the buffering, newline
translations, and encoding functions all remain at the top of the
channel stack. A pointer to the new top channel structure is returned.
If an error occurs when stacking the channel, NULL is returned
instead.</p>
<p>The <em>mask</em> parameter specifies the operations that are allowed
on the new channel. These can be a subset of the operations allowed on
the original channel. For example, a read-write channel may become
read-only after the <strong>Tcl_StackChannel</strong> call.</p>
<p>Closing a channel closes the channels stacked below it. The close of
stacked channels is executed in a way that allows buffered data to be
properly flushed.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_UnstackChannel</strong> reverses the process. The old
channel is associated with the channel name, and the processing module
added by <strong>Tcl_StackChannel</strong> is destroyed. If there is no
old channel, then <strong>Tcl_UnstackChannel</strong> is equivalent to
<strong>Tcl_Close</strong>. If an error occurs unstacking the channel,
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned, otherwise
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetTopChannel</strong> returns the top channel in the
stack of channels the supplied channel is part of.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetStackedChannel</strong> returns the channel in the
stack of channels which is just below the supplied channel.</p>
