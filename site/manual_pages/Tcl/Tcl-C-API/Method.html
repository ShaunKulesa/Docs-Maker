<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A method is an operation carried out on an object that is associated
with the object. Every method must be attached to either an object or a
class; methods attached to a class are associated with all instances
(direct and indirect) of that class.</p>
<p>Given a method, the entity that declared it can be found using
<strong>Tcl_MethodDeclarerClass</strong> which returns the class that
the method is attached to (or NULL if the method is not attached to any
class) and <strong>Tcl_MethodDeclarerObject</strong> which returns the
object that the method is attached to (or NULL if the method is not
attached to an object). The name of the method can be retrieved with
<strong>Tcl_MethodName</strong> and whether the method is exported is
retrieved with <strong>Tcl_MethodIsPublic</strong>. The type of the
method can also be introspected upon to a limited degree; the function
<strong>Tcl_MethodIsType</strong> returns whether a method is of a
particular type, assigning the per-method <em>clientData</em> to the
variable pointed to by <em>clientDataPtr</em> if (that is non-NULL) if
the type is matched.</p>
<h2 id="method-creation">METHOD CREATION</h2>
<p>Methods are created by <strong>Tcl_NewMethod</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_NewInstanceMethod</strong>, which create a method attached
to a class or an object respectively. In both cases, the
<em>nameObj</em> argument gives the name of the method to create, the
<em>isPublic</em> argument states whether the method should be exported
initially, the <em>methodTypePtr</em> argument describes the
implementation of the method (see the <strong>METHOD TYPES</strong>
section below) and the <em>clientData</em> argument gives some
implementation-specific data that is passed on to the implementation of
the method when it is called.</p>
<p>When the <em>nameObj</em> argument to <strong>Tcl_NewMethod</strong>
is NULL, an unnamed method is created, which is used for constructors
and destructors. Constructors should be installed into their class using
the <strong>Tcl_ClassSetConstructor</strong> function, and destructors
(which must not require any arguments) should be installed into their
class using the <strong>Tcl_ClassSetDestructor</strong> function.
Unnamed methods should not be used for any other purpose, and named
methods should not be used as either constructors or destructors. Also
note that a NULL <em>methodTypePtr</em> is used to provide internal
signaling, and should not be used in client code.</p>
<h2 id="method-call-contexts">METHOD CALL CONTEXTS</h2>
<p>When a method is called, a method-call context reference is passed in
as one of the arguments to the implementation function. This context can
be inspected to provide information about the caller, but should not be
retained beyond the moment when the method call terminates.</p>
<p>The method that is being called can be retrieved from the context by
using <strong>Tcl_ObjectContextMethod</strong>, and the object that
caused the method to be invoked can be retrieved with
<strong>Tcl_ObjectContextObject</strong>. The number of arguments that
are to be skipped (e.g. the object name and method name in a normal
method call) is read with <strong>Tcl_ObjectContextSkippedArgs</strong>,
and the context can also report whether it is working as a filter for
another method through
<strong>Tcl_ObjectContextIsFiltering</strong>.</p>
<p>During the execution of a method, the method implementation may
choose to invoke the stages of the method call chain that come after the
current method implementation. This (the core of the
<strong>next</strong> command) is done using
<strong>Tcl_ObjectContextInvokeNext</strong>. Note that this function
does not manipulate the call-frame stack, unlike the
<strong>next</strong> command; if the method implementation has pushed
one or more extra frames on the stack as part of its implementation, it
is also responsible for temporarily popping those frames from the stack
while the <strong>Tcl_ObjectContextInvokeNext</strong> function is
executing. Note also that the method-call context is <em>never</em>
deleted during the execution of this function.</p>
<h1 id="method-types">METHOD TYPES</h1>
<p>The types of methods are described by a pointer to a Tcl_MethodType
structure, which is defined as:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
    int version;
    const char *name;
    Tcl_MethodCallProc *callProc;
    Tcl_MethodDeleteProc *deleteProc;
    Tcl_CloneProc *cloneProc;
} Tcl_MethodType;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>version</em> field allows for future expansion of the
structure, and should always be declared equal to
TCL_OO_METHOD_VERSION_CURRENT. The <em>name</em> field provides a
human-readable name for the type, and is the value that is exposed via
the <strong>info class methodtype</strong> and <strong>info object
methodtype</strong> Tcl commands.</p>
<p>The <em>callProc</em> field gives a function that is called when the
method is invoked; it must never be NULL.</p>
<p>The <em>deleteProc</em> field gives a function that is used to delete
a particular method, and is called when the method is replaced or
removed; if the field is NULL, it is assumed that the method's
<em>clientData</em> needs no special action to delete.</p>
<p>The <em>cloneProc</em> field is either a function that is used to
copy a method's <em>clientData</em> (as part of
<strong>Tcl_CopyObjectInstance</strong>) or NULL to indicate that the
<em>clientData</em> can just be copied directly.</p>
<h2 id="tcl_methodcallproc-function-signature">TCL_METHODCALLPROC
FUNCTION SIGNATURE</h2>
<p>Functions matching this signature are called when the method is
invoked.</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_MethodCallProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_ObjectContext objectContext,
        int objc,
        Tcl_Obj *const *objv);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> argument to a Tcl_MethodCallProc is the value
that was given when the method was created, the <em>interp</em> is a
place in which to execute scripts and access variables as well as being
where to put the result of the method, and the <em>objc</em> and
<em>objv</em> fields give the parameter objects to the method. The
calling context of the method can be discovered through the
<em>objectContext</em> argument, and the return value from a
Tcl_MethodCallProc is any Tcl return code (e.g. TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR).</p>
<h2 id="tcl_methoddeleteproc-function-signature">TCL_METHODDELETEPROC
FUNCTION SIGNATURE</h2>
<p>Functions matching this signature are used when a method is deleted,
whether through a new method being created or because the object or
class is deleted.</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_MethodDeleteProc(
        ClientData clientData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> argument to a Tcl_MethodDeleteProc will be
the same as the value passed to the <em>clientData</em> argument to
<strong>Tcl_NewMethod</strong> or <strong>Tcl_NewInstanceMethod</strong>
when the method was created.</p>
<h2 id="tcl_cloneproc-function-signature">TCL_CLONEPROC FUNCTION
SIGNATURE</h2>
<p>Functions matching this signature are used to copy a method when the
object or class is copied using <strong>Tcl_CopyObjectInstance</strong>
(or <strong>oo::copy</strong>).</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_CloneProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        ClientData oldClientData,
        ClientData *newClientDataPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument gives a place to write an error message
when the attempt to clone the object is to fail, in which case the clone
procedure must also return TCL_ERROR; it should return TCL_OK otherwise.
The <em>oldClientData</em> field to a Tcl_CloneProc gives the value from
the method being copied from, and the <em>newClientDataPtr</em> field
will point to a variable in which to write the value for the method
being copied to.</p>
