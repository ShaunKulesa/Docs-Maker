<p>Tcl_PrintDouble - Convert floating value to string</p>

<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Before Tcl 8.0, the <strong>tcl_precision</strong> variable in this
interpreter controlled the conversion. As of Tcl 8.0, this argument is
ignored and the conversion is controlled by the
<strong>tcl_precision</strong> variable that is now shared by all
interpreters.</p>
<p>Floating-point value to be converted.</p>
<p>Where to store the string representing <em>value</em>. Must have at
least <strong>TCL_DOUBLE_SPACE</strong> characters of storage.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_PrintDouble</strong> generates a string that represents
the value of <em>value</em> and stores it in memory at the location
given by <em>dst</em>. It uses <strong>%g</strong> format to generate
the string, with one special twist: the string is guaranteed to contain
either a or an so that it does not look like an integer. Where
<strong>%g</strong> would generate an integer with no decimal point,
<strong>Tcl_PrintDouble</strong> adds</p>
<p>If the <strong>tcl_precision</strong> value is non-zero, the result
will have precisely that many digits of significance. If the value is
zero (the default), the result will have the fewest digits needed to
represent the number in such a way that
<strong>Tcl_NewDoubleObj</strong> will generate the same number when
presented with the given string. IEEE semantics of rounding to even
apply to the conversion.</p>
