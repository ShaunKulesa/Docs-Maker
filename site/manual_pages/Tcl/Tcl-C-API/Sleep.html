<p>Number of milliseconds to sleep.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This procedure delays the calling process by the number of
milliseconds given by the <em>ms</em> parameter and returns after that
time has elapsed. It is typically used for things like flashing a
button, where the delay is short and the application need not do
anything while it waits. For longer delays where the application needs
to respond to other events during the delay, the procedure
<strong>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</strong> should be used instead of
<strong>Tcl_Sleep</strong>.</p>
