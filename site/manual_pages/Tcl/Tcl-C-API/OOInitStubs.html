<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tcl_OOInitStubs - initialize library access to TclOO
functionality</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tclOO.h&gt;

const char *
Tcl_OOInitStubs(interp)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>The Tcl interpreter that the TclOO API is integrated with and whose C
interface is going to be used.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>When an extension library is going to use the C interface exposed by
TclOO, it should use <strong>Tcl_OOInitStubs</strong> to initialize its
access to that interface from within its
<em>*</em><strong>_Init</strong> (or
<em>*</em><strong>_SafeInit</strong>) function, passing in the
<em>interp</em> that was passed into that routine as context. If the
result of calling <strong>Tcl_OOInitStubs</strong> is NULL, the
initialization failed and an error message will have been left in the
interpreter's result. Otherwise, the initialization succeeded and the
TclOO API may thereafter be used; the version of the TclOO API is
returned.</p>
<p>When using this function, either the C #define symbol
<strong>USE_TCLOO_STUBS</strong> should be defined and your library code
linked against the Tcl stub library, or that #define symbol should
<em>not</em> be defined and your library code linked against the Tcl
main library directly.</p>
<h1 id="backward-compatibility-note">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY NOTE</h1>
<p>If you are linking against the Tcl 8.5 forward compatibility package
for TclOO, <em>only</em> the stub-enabled configuration is supported and
you should also link against the TclOO independent stub library; that
library is an integrated part of the main Tcl stub library in Tcl
8.6.</p>
