Tcl_Channel

<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>The identifier for the standard channel to retrieve or modify. Must
be one of <strong>TCL_STDIN</strong>, <strong>TCL_STDOUT</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_STDERR</strong>.</p>
<p>The channel to use as the new value for the specified standard
channel.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Tcl defines three special channels that are used by various I/O
related commands if no other channels are specified. The standard input
channel has a channel name of <strong>stdin</strong> and is used by
<strong>read</strong> and <strong>gets</strong>. The standard output
channel is named <strong>stdout</strong> and is used by
<strong>puts</strong>. The standard error channel is named
<strong>stderr</strong> and is used for reporting errors. In addition,
the standard channels are inherited by any child processes created using
<strong>exec</strong> or <strong>open</strong> in the absence of any
other redirections.</p>
<p>The standard channels are actually aliases for other normal channels.
The current channel associated with a standard channel can be retrieved
by calling <strong>Tcl_GetStdChannel</strong> with one of
<strong>TCL_STDIN</strong>, <strong>TCL_STDOUT</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_STDERR</strong> as the <em>type</em>. The return value will
be a valid channel, or NULL.</p>
<p>A new channel can be set for the standard channel specified by
<em>type</em> by calling <strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong> with a new
channel or NULL in the <em>channel</em> argument. If the specified
channel is closed by a later call to <strong>Tcl_Close</strong>, then
the corresponding standard channel will automatically be set to
NULL.</p>
<p>If a non-NULL value for <em>channel</em> is passed to
<strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong>, then that same value should be
passed to <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>, like so:</p>
<pre><code>Tcl_RegisterChannel(NULL, channel);</code></pre>
<p>This is a workaround for a misfeature in
<strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong> that it fails to do some reference
counting housekeeping. This misfeature cannot be corrected without
contradicting the assumptions of some existing code that calls
<strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>Tcl_GetStdChannel</strong> is called before
<strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong>, Tcl will construct a new channel to
wrap the appropriate platform-specific standard file handle. If
<strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong> is called before
<strong>Tcl_GetStdChannel</strong>, then the default channel will not be
created.</p>
<p>If one of the standard channels is set to NULL, either by calling
<strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong> with a NULL <em>channel</em>
argument, or by calling <strong>Tcl_Close</strong> on the channel, then
the next call to <strong>Tcl_CreateChannel</strong> will automatically
set the standard channel with the newly created channel. If more than
one standard channel is NULL, then the standard channels will be
assigned starting with standard input, followed by standard output, with
standard error being last.</p>
<p>See <strong>Tcl_StandardChannels</strong> for a general treatise
about standard channels and the behavior of the Tcl library with regard
to them.</p>
