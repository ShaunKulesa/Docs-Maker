<p>Interpreter in which to execute the script. The interpreter's result
is modified to hold the result or error message from the script.</p>
<p>A Tcl value containing the script to execute.</p>

<p>The number of values in the array pointed to by <em>objv</em>; this
is also the number of words in the command.</p>
<p>Points to an array of pointers to values; each value holds the value
of a single word in the command to execute.</p>
<p>The number of bytes in <em>script</em>, not including any null
terminating character. If -1, then all characters up to the first null

<p>Points to first byte of script to execute (null-terminated and

<p>String forming part of a Tcl script.</p>
<p>An argument list which must have been initialized using

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The procedures described here are invoked to execute Tcl scripts in
various forms. <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> is the core procedure and
is used by many of the others. It executes the commands in the script
stored in <em>objPtr</em> until either an error occurs or the end of the
script is reached. If this is the first time <em>objPtr</em> has been
executed, its commands are compiled into bytecode instructions which are
then executed. The bytecodes are saved in <em>objPtr</em> so that the
compilation step can be skipped if the value is evaluated again in the
future.</p>
<p>The return value from <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> (and all the
other procedures described here) is a Tcl completion code with one of
the values <strong>TCL_OK</strong>, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>,
<strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>, <strong>TCL_BREAK</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_CONTINUE</strong>, or possibly some other integer value
originating in an extension. In addition, a result value or error
message is left in <em>interp</em>'s result; it can be retrieved using
<strong>Tcl_GetObjResult</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_EvalFile</strong> reads the file given by
<em>fileName</em> and evaluates its contents as a Tcl script. It returns
the same information as <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>. If the file
could not be read then a Tcl error is returned to describe why the file
could not be read. The eofchar for files is (^Z) for all platforms. If
you require a in code for string comparison, you can use or which will
be safely substituted by the Tcl interpreter into</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_EvalObjv</strong> executes a single pre-parsed command
instead of a script. The <em>objc</em> and <em>objv</em> arguments
contain the values of the words for the Tcl command, one word in each
value in <em>objv</em>. <strong>Tcl_EvalObjv</strong> evaluates the
command and returns a completion code and result just like
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>. The caller of
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjv</strong> has to manage the reference count of the
elements of <em>objv</em>, insuring that the values are valid until
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjv</strong> returns.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> is similar to
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> except that the script to be executed is
supplied as a string instead of a value and no compilation occurs. The
string should be a proper UTF-8 string as converted by
<strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</strong> when it is known to possibly contain
upper ASCII characters whose possible combinations might be a UTF-8
special code. The string is parsed and executed directly (using
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjv</strong>) instead of compiling it and executing the
bytecodes. In situations where it is known that the script will never be
executed again, <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> may be faster than
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>. <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> returns a
completion code and result just like <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>.
Note: for backward compatibility with versions before Tcl 8.0,
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> copies the value result in <em>interp</em> to
<em>interp-&gt;result</em> (use is deprecated) where it can be accessed
directly. This makes <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> somewhat slower than
<strong>Tcl_EvalEx</strong>, which does not do the copy.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_EvalEx</strong> is an extended version of
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> that takes additional arguments
<em>numBytes</em> and <em>flags</em>. For the efficiency reason given
above, <strong>Tcl_EvalEx</strong> is generally preferred over
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GlobalEval</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GlobalEvalObj</strong> are older procedures that are now
deprecated. They are similar to <strong>Tcl_EvalEx</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> except that the script is evaluated in
the global namespace and its variable context consists of global
variables only (it ignores any Tcl procedures that are active). These
functions are equivalent to using the <strong>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</strong>
flag (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_VarEval</strong> takes any number of string arguments of
any length, concatenates them into a single string, then calls
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> to execute that string as a Tcl command. It
returns the result of the command and also modifies
<em>interp-&gt;result</em> in the same way as <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>.
The last argument to <strong>Tcl_VarEval</strong> must be NULL to
indicate the end of arguments. <strong>Tcl_VarEval</strong> is now
deprecated.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_VarEvalVA</strong> is the same as
<strong>Tcl_VarEval</strong> except that instead of taking a variable
number of arguments it takes an argument list. Like
<strong>Tcl_VarEval</strong>, <strong>Tcl_VarEvalVA</strong> is
deprecated.</p>
<h1 id="flag-bits">FLAG BITS</h1>
<p>Any ORed combination of the following values may be used for the
<em>flags</em> argument to procedures such as
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>TCL_EVAL_DIRECT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag is only used by <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>; it is
ignored by other procedures. If this flag bit is set, the script is not
compiled to bytecodes; instead it is executed directly as is done by
<strong>Tcl_EvalEx</strong>. The <strong>TCL_EVAL_DIRECT</strong> flag
is useful in situations where the contents of a value are going to
change immediately, so the bytecodes will not be reused in a future
execution. In this case, it is faster to execute the script
directly.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this flag is set, the script is evaluated in the global namespace
instead of the current namespace and its variable context consists of
global variables only (it ignores any Tcl procedures that are
active).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-details">MISCELLANEOUS DETAILS</h1>
<p>During the processing of a Tcl command it is legal to make nested
calls to evaluate other commands (this is how procedures and some
control structures are implemented). If a code other than
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned from a nested
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> invocation, then the caller should
normally return immediately, passing that same return code back to its
caller, and so on until the top-level application is reached. A few
commands, like <strong>for</strong>, will check for certain return
codes, like <strong>TCL_BREAK</strong> and
<strong>TCL_CONTINUE</strong>, and process them specially without
returning.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> keeps track of how many nested
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> invocations are in progress for
<em>interp</em>. If a code of <strong>TCL_RETURN</strong>,
<strong>TCL_BREAK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_CONTINUE</strong> is about to
be returned from the topmost <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> invocation
for <em>interp</em>, it converts the return code to
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> and sets <em>interp</em>'s result to an error
message indicating that the <strong>return</strong>,
<strong>break</strong>, or <strong>continue</strong> command was invoked
in an inappropriate place. This means that top-level applications should
never see a return code from <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> other than
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>.</p>
