<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>The interpreter in which the ensemble is to be created or found. Also
where error result messages are written. The functions whose names start
with <strong>Tcl_GetEnsemble</strong> may have a NULL for the
<em>interp</em>, but all other functions must not.</p>
<p>The name of the ensemble command to be created.</p>
<p>The namespace to which the ensemble command is to be bound, or NULL
for the current namespace.</p>
<p>An ORed set of flag bits describing the basic configuration of the
ensemble. Currently only one bit has meaning,
<strong>TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX</strong>, which is present when the ensemble
command should also match unambiguous prefixes of subcommands.</p>
<p>A value holding the name of the ensemble command to look up.</p>
<p>An ORed set of flag bits controlling the behavior of
<strong>Tcl_FindEnsemble</strong>. Currently only
<strong>TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG</strong> is supported.</p>
<p>A normal command token that refers to an ensemble command, or which
you wish to use for testing as an ensemble command in
<strong>Tcl_IsEnsemble</strong>.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the current ensemble flag
bits; currently only the bit <strong>TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX</strong> is
defined.</p>
<p>A dictionary value to use for the subcommand to implementation
command prefix mapping dictionary in the ensemble. May be NULL if the
mapping dictionary is to be removed.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the current ensemble
mapping dictionary.</p>
<p>A list value to use for the list of formal pre-subcommand parameters,
the defined list of subcommands in the dictionary or the unknown
subcommand handler command prefix. May be NULL if the subcommand list or
unknown handler are to be removed.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the current list of formal
pre-subcommand parameters, the defined list of subcommands or the
current unknown handler prefix.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the handle of the namespace
to which the ensemble is bound.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>An ensemble is a command, bound to some namespace, which consists of
a collection of subcommands implemented by other Tcl commands. The first
argument to the ensemble command is always interpreted as a selector
that states what subcommand to execute.</p>
<p>Ensembles are created using <strong>Tcl_CreateEnsemble</strong>,
which takes four arguments: the interpreter to work within, the name of
the ensemble to create, the namespace within the interpreter to bind the
ensemble to, and the default set of ensemble flags. The result of the
function is the command token for the ensemble, which may be used to
further configure the ensemble using the API described below in
<strong>ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES</strong>.</p>
<p>Given the name of an ensemble command, the token for that command may
be retrieved using <strong>Tcl_FindEnsemble</strong>. If the given
command name (in <em>cmdNameObj</em>) does not refer to an ensemble
command, the result of the function is NULL and (if the
<strong>TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG</strong> bit is set in <em>flags</em>) an
error message is left in the interpreter result.</p>
<p>A command token may be checked to see if it refers to an ensemble
using <strong>Tcl_IsEnsemble</strong>. This returns 1 if the token
refers to an ensemble, or 0 otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="ensemble-properties">ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES</h2>
<p>Every ensemble has four read-write properties and a read-only
property. The properties are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>flags</strong> (read-write)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The set of flags for the ensemble, expressed as a bit-field.
Currently, the only public flag is <strong>TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX</strong>
which is set when unambiguous prefixes of subcommands are permitted to
be resolved to implementations as well as exact matches. The flags may
be read and written using <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleFlags</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleFlags</strong> respectively. The result of both
of those functions is a Tcl result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token does not refer to an
ensemble).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>mapping dictionary</strong> (read-write)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A dictionary containing a mapping from subcommand names to lists of
words to use as a command prefix (replacing the first two words of the
command which are the ensemble command itself and the subcommand name),
or NULL if every subcommand is to be mapped to the command with the same
unqualified name in the ensemble's bound namespace. Defaults to NULL.
May be read and written using
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleMappingDict</strong> respectively. The result of
both of those functions is a Tcl result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>,
or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token does not refer to an
ensemble) and the dictionary obtained from
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict</strong> should always be treated as
immutable even if it is unshared. All command names in prefixes set via
<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleMappingDict</strong> must be fully qualified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>formal pre-subcommand parameter list</strong>
(read-write)</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>A list of formal parameter names (the names only being used when
generating error messages) that come at invocation of the ensemble
between the name of the ensemble and the subcommand argument. NULL (the
default) is equivalent to the empty list. May be read and written using
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleParameterList</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleParameterList</strong> respectively. The result
of both of those functions is a Tcl result code
(<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token
does not refer to an ensemble) and the dictionary obtained from
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleParameterList</strong> should always be treated
as immutable even if it is unshared.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>subcommand list</strong> (read-write)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of all the subcommand names for the ensemble, or NULL if this
is to be derived from either the keys of the mapping dictionary (see
above) or (if that is also NULL) from the set of commands exported by
the bound namespace. May be read and written using
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong> respectively. The result
of both of those functions is a Tcl result code
(<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token
does not refer to an ensemble) and the list obtained from
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong> should always be treated
as immutable even if it is unshared.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>unknown subcommand handler command prefix</strong>
(read-write)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of words to prepend on the front of any subcommand when the
subcommand is unknown to the ensemble (according to the current prefix
handling rule); see the <strong>namespace ensemble</strong> command for
more details. If NULL, the default behavior - generate a suitable error
message - will be used when an unknown subcommand is encountered. May be
read and written using <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong>
and <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong> respectively. The
result of both functions is a Tcl result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>,
or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token does not refer to an
ensemble) and the list obtained from
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong> should always be treated
as immutable even if it is unshared.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>bound namespace</strong> (read-only)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The namespace to which the ensemble is bound; when the namespace is
deleted, so too will the ensemble, and this namespace is also the
namespace whose list of exported commands is used if both the mapping
dictionary and the subcommand list properties are NULL. May be read
using <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleNamespace</strong> which returns a Tcl
result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if
the token does not refer to an ensemble).</p>
