<p>Tcl_StandardChannels - How the Tcl library deals with the standard
channels</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This page explains the initialization and use of standard channels in
the Tcl library.</p>
<p>The term <em>standard channels</em> comes out of the Unix world and
refers to the three channels automatically opened by the OS for each new
application. They are <strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong>
and <strong>stderr</strong>. The first is the standard input an
application can read from, the other two refer to writable channels, one
for regular output and the other for error messages.</p>
<p>Tcl generalizes this concept in a cross-platform way and exposes
standard channels to the script level.</p>
<h2 id="application-programming-interfaces">APPLICATION PROGRAMMING
INTERFACES</h2>
<p>The public API procedures dealing directly with standard channels are
<strong>Tcl_GetStdChannel</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong>. Additional public APIs to consider
are <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_CreateChannel</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GetChannel</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="initialization-of-tcl-standard-channels">INITIALIZATION OF TCL
STANDARD CHANNELS</h1>
<p>Standard channels are initialized by the Tcl library in three cases:
when explicitly requested, when implicitly required before returning
channel information, or when implicitly required during registration of
a new channel.</p>
<p>These cases differ in how they handle unavailable platform- specific
standard channels. (A channel is not if it could not be successfully
opened; for example, in a Tcl application run as a Windows NT
service.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A single standard channel is initialized when it is explicitly
specified in a call to <strong>Tcl_SetStdChannel</strong>. The states of
the other standard channels are unaffected.</p>
<p>Missing platform-specific standard channels do not matter here. This
approach is not available at the script level.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>All uninitialized standard channels are initialized to
platform-specific default values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>(a)</dt>
<dd>
<p>when open channels are listed with
<strong>Tcl_GetChannelNames</strong> (or the <strong>file
channels</strong> script command), or</p>
</dd>
<dt>(b)</dt>
<dd>
<p>when information about any standard channel is requested with a call
to <strong>Tcl_GetStdChannel</strong>, or with a call to
<strong>Tcl_GetChannel</strong> which specifies one of the standard
names (<strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong> and
<strong>stderr</strong>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In case of missing platform-specific standard channels, the Tcl
standard channels are considered as initialized and then immediately
closed. This means that the first three Tcl channels then opened by the
application are designated as the Tcl standard channels.</p>
</dd>
<dt>3)</dt>
<dd>
<p>All uninitialized standard channels are initialized to
platform-specific default values when a user-requested channel is
registered with <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In case of unavailable platform-specific standard channels the
channel whose creation caused the initialization of the Tcl standard
channels is made a normal channel. The next three Tcl channels opened by
the application are designated as the Tcl standard channels. In other
words, of the first four Tcl channels opened by the application the
second to fourth are designated as the Tcl standard channels.</p>
<h1 id="re-initialization-of-tcl-standard-channels">RE-INITIALIZATION OF
TCL STANDARD CHANNELS</h1>
<p>Once a Tcl standard channel is initialized through one of the methods
above, closing this Tcl standard channel will cause the next call to
<strong>Tcl_CreateChannel</strong> to make the new channel the new
standard channel, too. If more than one Tcl standard channel was closed
<strong>Tcl_CreateChannel</strong> will fill the empty slots in the
order <strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong> and
<strong>stderr</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateChannel</strong> will not try to reinitialize an
empty slot if that slot was not initialized before. It is this behavior
which enables an application to employ method 1 of initialization,
i.e.Â to create and designate their own Tcl standard channels.</p>
<h1 id="shell-specific-details">SHELL-SPECIFIC DETAILS</h1>
<h2 id="tclsh">tclsh</h2>
<p>The Tcl shell (or rather the function <strong>Tcl_Main</strong>,
which forms the core of the shell's implementation) uses method 2 to
initialize the standard channels.</p>
<h2 id="wish">wish</h2>
<p>The windowing shell (or rather the function
<strong>Tk_MainEx</strong>, which forms the core of the shell's
implementation) uses method 1 to initialize the standard channels (See
<strong>Tk_InitConsoleChannels</strong>) on non-Unix platforms. On Unix
platforms, <strong>Tk_MainEx</strong> implicitly uses method 2 to
initialize the standard channels.</p>
