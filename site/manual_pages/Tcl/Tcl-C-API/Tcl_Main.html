<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_Main</strong> can serve as the main program for Tcl-based
shell applications. A is a program like tclsh or wish that supports both
interactive interpretation of Tcl and evaluation of a script contained
in a file given as a command line argument. <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> is
offered as a convenience to developers of shell applications, so they do
not have to reproduce all of the code for proper initialization of the
Tcl library and interactive shell operation. Other styles of embedding
Tcl in an application are not supported by <strong>Tcl_Main</strong>.
Those must be achieved by calling lower level functions in the Tcl
library directly.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> function has been offered by the Tcl
library since release Tcl 7.4. In older releases of Tcl, the Tcl library
itself defined a function <strong>main</strong>, but that lacks
flexibility of embedding style and having a function
<strong>main</strong> in a library (particularly a shared library)
causes problems on many systems. Having <strong>main</strong> in the Tcl
library would also make it hard to use Tcl in C++ programs, since C++
programs must have special C++ <strong>main</strong> functions.</p>
<p>Normally each shell application contains a small
<strong>main</strong> function that does nothing but invoke
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong>. <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> then does all the
work of creating and running a <strong>tclsh</strong>-like
application.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Main</strong> is not provided by the public interface of
Tcl's stub library. Programs that call <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> must be
linked against the standard Tcl library. Extensions (stub-enabled or
not) are not intended to call <strong>Tcl_Main</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Main</strong> is not thread-safe. It should only be
called by a single main thread of a multi-threaded application. This
restriction is not a problem with normal use described above.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Main</strong> and therefore all applications based upon
it, like <strong>tclsh</strong>, use <strong>Tcl_GetStdChannel</strong>
to initialize the standard channels to their default values. See
<strong>Tcl_StandardChannels</strong> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Main</strong> supports two modes of operation, depending
on whether the filename and encoding of a startup script has been
established. The routines <strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GetStartupScript</strong> are the tools for controlling this
configuration of <strong>Tcl_Main</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> registers the value
<em>path</em> as the name of the file for <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> to
evaluate as its startup script. The value <em>encoding</em> is Tcl's
name for the encoding used to store the text in that file. A value of
<strong>NULL</strong> for <em>encoding</em> is a signal to use the
system encoding. A value of <strong>NULL</strong> for <em>path</em>
erases any existing registration so that <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> will
not evaluate any startup script.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetStartupScript</strong> queries the registered file
name and encoding set by the most recent
<strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> call in the same thread. The
stored file name is returned, and the stored encoding name is written to
space pointed to by <em>encodingPtr</em>, when that is not NULL.</p>
<p>The file name and encoding values managed by the routines
<strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GetStartupScript</strong> are stored per-thread. Although
the storage and retrieval functions of these routines work in any
thread, only those calls in the same main thread as
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong> can have any influence on it.</p>
<p>The caller of <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> may call
<strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> first to establish its desired
startup script. If <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> finds that no such startup
script has been established, it consults the first few arguments in
<em>argv</em>. If they match ?<strong>-encoding</strong> <em>name</em>?
<em>fileName</em>, where <em>fileName</em> does not begin with the
character <em>-</em>, then <em>fileName</em> is taken to be the name of
a file containing a <em>startup script</em>, and <em>name</em> is taken
to be the name of the encoding of the contents of that file.
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong> then calls
<strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> with these values.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Main</strong> then defines in its main interpreter the
Tcl variables <em>argc</em>, <em>argv</em>, <em>argv0</em>, and
<em>tcl_interactive</em>, as described in the documentation for
<strong>tclsh</strong>.</p>
<p>When it has finished its own initialization, but before it processes
commands, <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> calls the procedure given by the
<em>appInitProc</em> argument. This procedure provides a for the
application to perform its own initialization of the interpreter created
by <strong>Tcl_Main</strong>, such as defining application-specific
commands. The application initialization routine might also call
<strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> to (re-)set the file and encoding
to be used as a startup script. The procedure must have an interface
that matches the type <strong>Tcl_AppInitProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p><em>AppInitProc</em> is almost always a pointer to
<strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong>; for more details on this procedure, see
the documentation for <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong>.</p>
<p>When the <em>appInitProc</em> is finished, <strong>Tcl_Main</strong>
calls <strong>Tcl_GetStartupScript</strong> to determine what startup
script has been requested, if any. If a startup script has been
provided, <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> attempts to evaluate it. Otherwise,
interactive mode begins with examination of the variable
<em>tcl_rcFileName</em> in the main interpreter. If that variable exists
and holds the name of a readable file, the contents of that file are
evaluated in the main interpreter. Then interactive operations begin,
with prompts and command evaluation results written to the standard
output channel, and commands read from the standard input channel and
then evaluated. The prompts written to the standard output channel may
be customized by defining the Tcl variables <em>tcl_prompt1</em> and
<em>tcl_prompt2</em> as described in the documentation for
<strong>tclsh</strong>. The prompts and command evaluation results are
written to the standard output channel only if the Tcl variable
<em>tcl_interactive</em> in the main interpreter holds a non-zero
integer value.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetMainLoop</strong> allows setting an event loop
procedure to be run. This allows, for example, Tk to be dynamically
loaded and set its event loop. The event loop will run following the
startup script. If you are in interactive mode, setting the main loop
procedure will cause the prompt to become fileevent based and then the
loop procedure is called. When the loop procedure returns in interactive
mode, interactive operation will continue. The main loop procedure must
have an interface that matches the type
<strong>Tcl_MainLoopProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_MainLoopProc(void);</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tcl_Main</strong> does not return. Normally a program based
on <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> will terminate when the
<strong>exit</strong> command is evaluated. In interactive mode, if an
EOF or channel error is encountered on the standard input channel, then
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong> itself will evaluate the <strong>exit</strong>
command after the main loop procedure (if any) returns. In
non-interactive mode, after <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> evaluates the
startup script, and the main loop procedure (if any) returns,
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong> will also evaluate the <strong>exit</strong>
command.</p>
