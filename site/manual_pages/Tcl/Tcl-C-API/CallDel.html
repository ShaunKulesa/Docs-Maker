<p>Tcl_CallWhenDeleted, Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted - Arrange for callback

<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

Tcl_CallWhenDeleted(interp, proc, clientData)

Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted(interp, proc, clientData)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter with which to associated callback.</p>
<p>Procedure to call when <em>interp</em> is deleted.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_CallWhenDeleted</strong> arranges for <em>proc</em> to be
called by <strong>Tcl_DeleteInterp</strong> if/when <em>interp</em> is
deleted at some future time. <em>Proc</em> will be invoked just before
the interpreter is deleted, but the interpreter will still be valid at
the time of the call. <em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result
that match the type <strong>Tcl_InterpDeleteProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_InterpDeleteProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> and <em>interp</em> parameters are copies of
the <em>clientData</em> and <em>interp</em> arguments given to
<strong>Tcl_CallWhenDeleted</strong>. Typically, <em>clientData</em>
points to an application-specific data structure that <em>proc</em> uses
to perform cleanup when an interpreter is about to go away.
<em>Proc</em> does not return a value.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted</strong> cancels a previous call to
<strong>Tcl_CallWhenDeleted</strong> with the same arguments, so that
<em>proc</em> will not be called after all when <em>interp</em> is
deleted. If there is no deletion callback that matches <em>interp</em>,
<em>proc</em>, and <em>clientData</em> then the call to
<strong>Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted</strong> has no effect.</p>
<p>Note that if the callback is being used to delete a resource that
<em>must</em> be released on exit,
<strong>Tcl_CreateExitHandler</strong> should be used to ensure that a
callback is received even if the application terminates without deleting
the interpreter.</p>
