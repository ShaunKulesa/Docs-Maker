<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tcl_RecordAndEval - save command on history list before
evaluating</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

int
Tcl_RecordAndEval(interp, cmd, flags)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Tcl interpreter in which to evaluate command.</p>
<p>Command (or sequence of commands) to execute.</p>
<p>An OR'ed combination of flag bits. <strong>TCL_NO_EVAL</strong> means
record the command but do not evaluate it.
<strong>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</strong> means evaluate the command at global
level instead of the current stack level.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_RecordAndEval</strong> is invoked to record a command as
an event on the history list and then execute it using
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> (or <strong>Tcl_GlobalEval</strong> if the
<strong>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</strong> bit is set in <em>flags</em>). It
returns a completion code such as <strong>TCL_OK</strong> just like
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> and it leaves information in the interpreter's
result. If you do not want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> instead of
<strong>Tcl_RecordAndEval</strong>. Normally
<strong>Tcl_RecordAndEval</strong> is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to allow the
user to re-issue recently-invoked commands. If the <em>flags</em>
argument contains the <strong>TCL_NO_EVAL</strong> bit then the command
is recorded without being evaluated.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Tcl_RecordAndEval</strong> has been largely
replaced by the value-based procedure
<strong>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</strong>. That value-based procedure
records and optionally executes a command held in a Tcl value instead of
a string.</p>
