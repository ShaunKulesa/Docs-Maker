<p>Interpreter to use for error reporting; if NULL, then no message is
provided on errors.</p>
<p>The string value of this value is used to search through
<em>tablePtr</em>. The internal representation is modified to hold the
index of the matching table entry.</p>
<p>An array of null-terminated strings. The end of the array is marked
by a NULL string pointer. Note that references to the <em>tablePtr</em>
may be retained in the internal representation of <em>objPtr</em>, so
this should represent the address of a statically-allocated array.</p>
<p>An array of arbitrary type, typically some <strong>struct</strong>
type. The first member of the structure must be a null-terminated
string. The size of the structure is given by <em>offset</em>. Note that
references to the <em>structTablePtr</em> may be retained in the
internal representation of <em>objPtr</em>, so this should represent the
address of a statically-allocated array of structures.</p>
<p>The offset to add to structTablePtr to get to the next entry. The end
of the array is marked by a NULL string pointer.</p>
<p>Null-terminated string describing what is being looked up, such as
<strong>option</strong>. This string is included in error messages.</p>
<p>OR-ed combination of bits providing additional information for
operation. The only bit that is currently defined is
<strong>TCL_EXACT</strong>.</p>
<p>The index of the string in <em>tablePtr</em> that matches the value
of <em>objPtr</em> is returned here.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures provide an efficient way for looking up keywords,
switch names, option names, and similar things where the literal value
of a Tcl value must be chosen from a predefined set.
<strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong> compares <em>objPtr</em> against
each of the strings in <em>tablePtr</em> to find a match. A match occurs
if <em>objPtr</em>'s string value is identical to one of the strings in
<em>tablePtr</em>, or if it is a non-empty unique abbreviation for
exactly one of the strings in <em>tablePtr</em> and the
<strong>TCL_EXACT</strong> flag was not specified; in either case the
index of the matching entry is stored at <em>*indexPtr</em> and
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned.</p>
<p>If there is no matching entry, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned
and an error message is left in <em>interp</em>'s result if
<em>interp</em> is not NULL. <em>Msg</em> is included in the error
message to indicate what was being looked up. For example, if
<em>msg</em> is <strong>option</strong> the error message will have a
form like</p>
<p>If <strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong> completes successfully it
modifies the internal representation of <em>objPtr</em> to hold the
address of the table and the index of the matching entry. If
<strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong> is invoked again with the same
<em>objPtr</em> and <em>tablePtr</em> arguments (e.g. during a
reinvocation of a Tcl command), it returns the matching index
immediately without having to redo the lookup operation. Note:
<strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong> assumes that the entries in
<em>tablePtr</em> are static: they must not change between invocations.
If the value of <em>objPtr</em> is the empty string,
<strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong> will treat it as a non-matching
value and return <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct</strong> works just like
<strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong>, except that instead of treating
<em>tablePtr</em> as an array of string pointers, it treats it as a
pointer to the first string in a series of strings that have
<em>offset</em> bytes between them (i.e. that there is a pointer to the
first array of characters at <em>tablePtr</em>, a pointer to the second
array of characters at <em>tablePtr</em>+<em>offset</em> bytes, etc.)
This is particularly useful when processing things like
<strong>Tk_ConfigurationSpec</strong>, whose string keys are in the same
place in each of several array elements.</p>
