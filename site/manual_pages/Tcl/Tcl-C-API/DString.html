<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Dynamic strings provide a mechanism for building up arbitrarily long
strings by gradually appending information. If the dynamic string is
short then there will be no memory allocation overhead; as the string
gets larger, additional space will be allocated as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringInit</strong> initializes a dynamic string to zero
length. The Tcl_DString structure must have been allocated by the
caller. No assumptions are made about the current state of the
structure; anything already in it is discarded. If the structure has
been used previously, <strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong> should be called
first to free up any memory allocated for the old string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringAppend</strong> adds new information to a dynamic
string, allocating more memory for the string if needed. If
<em>length</em> is less than zero then everything in <em>bytes</em> is
appended to the dynamic string; otherwise <em>length</em> specifies the
number of bytes to append. <strong>Tcl_DStringAppend</strong> returns a
pointer to the characters of the new string. The string can also be
retrieved from the <em>string</em> field of the Tcl_DString
structure.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</strong> is similar to
<strong>Tcl_DStringAppend</strong> except that it does not take a
<em>length</em> argument (it appends all of <em>element</em>) and it
converts the string to a proper list element before appending.
<strong>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</strong> adds a separator space before
the new list element unless the new list element is the first in a list
or sub-list (i.e.Â either the current string is empty, or it contains the
single character or the last two characters of the current string are
<strong>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</strong> returns a pointer to the
characters of the new string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringStartSublist</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_DStringEndSublist</strong> can be used to create nested
lists. To append a list element that is itself a sublist, first call
<strong>Tcl_DStringStartSublist</strong>, then call
<strong>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</strong> for each of the elements in
the sublist, then call <strong>Tcl_DStringEndSublist</strong> to end the
sublist. <strong>Tcl_DStringStartSublist</strong> appends a space
character if needed, followed by an open brace;
<strong>Tcl_DStringEndSublist</strong> appends a close brace. Lists can
be nested to any depth.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringLength</strong> is a macro that returns the
current length of a dynamic string (not including the terminating null
character). <strong>Tcl_DStringValue</strong> is a macro that returns a
pointer to the current contents of a dynamic string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringSetLength</strong> changes the length of a dynamic
string. If <em>newLength</em> is less than the string's current length,
then the string is truncated. If <em>newLength</em> is greater than the
string's current length, then the string will become longer and new
space will be allocated for the string if needed. However,
<strong>Tcl_DStringSetLength</strong> will not initialize the new space
except to provide a terminating null character; it is up to the caller
to fill in the new space. <strong>Tcl_DStringSetLength</strong> does not
free up the string's storage space even if the string is truncated to
zero length, so <strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong> will still need to be
called.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringTrunc</strong> changes the length of a dynamic
string. This procedure is now deprecated.
<strong>Tcl_DStringSetLength</strong> should be used instead.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong> should be called when you are
finished using the string. It frees up any memory that was allocated for
the string and reinitializes the string's value to an empty string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringResult</strong> sets the result of <em>interp</em>
to the value of the dynamic string given by <em>dsPtr</em>. It does this
by moving a pointer from <em>dsPtr</em> to the interpreter's result.
This saves the cost of allocating new memory and copying the string.
<strong>Tcl_DStringResult</strong> also reinitializes the dynamic string
to an empty string.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DStringGetResult</strong> does the opposite of
<strong>Tcl_DStringResult</strong>. It sets the value of <em>dsPtr</em>
to the result of <em>interp</em> and it clears <em>interp</em>'s result.
If possible it does this by moving a pointer rather than by copying the
string.</p>
