<p>Procedure to invoke.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> arranges for <em>proc</em> to be
invoked when the application becomes idle. The application is considered
to be idle when <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> has been called, could
not find any events to handle, and is about to go to sleep waiting for
an event to occur. At this point all pending
<strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> handlers are invoked. For each call to
<strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> there will be a single call to
<em>proc</em>; after <em>proc</em> is invoked the handler is
automatically removed. <strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> is only usable in
programs that use <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> to dispatch
events.</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tcl_IdleProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_IdleProc(
        ClientData clientData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to <strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong>.
Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to a data structure containing
application-specific information about what <em>proc</em> should do.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_CancelIdleCall</strong> may be used to cancel one or more
previous calls to <strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong>: if there is a
<strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> handler registered for <em>proc</em> and
<em>clientData</em>, then it is removed without invoking it. If there is
more than one handler on the idle list that refers to <em>proc</em> and
<em>clientData</em>, all of the handlers are removed. If no existing
handlers match <em>proc</em> and <em>clientData</em> then nothing
happens.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> is most useful in situations where
(a) a piece of work will have to be done but (b) it is possible that
something will happen in the near future that will change what has to be
done or require something different to be done.
<strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> allows the actual work to be deferred
until all pending events have been processed. At this point the exact
work to be done will presumably be known and it can be done exactly
once.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</strong> might be used by an
editor to defer display updates until all pending commands have been
processed. Without this feature, redundant redisplays might occur in
some situations, such as the processing of a command file.</p>
<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>At present it is not safe for an idle callback to reschedule itself
continuously. This will interact badly with certain features of Tk that
attempt to wait for all idle callbacks to complete. If you would like
for an idle callback to reschedule itself continuously, it is better to
use a timer handler with a zero timeout period.</p>
