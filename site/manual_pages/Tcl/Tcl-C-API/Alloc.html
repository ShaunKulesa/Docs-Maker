<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Size in bytes of the memory block to allocate.</p>
<p>Pointer to memory block to free or realloc.</p>
<p>Initialized DString pointer.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures provide a platform and compiler independent
interface for memory allocation. Programs that need to transfer
ownership of memory blocks between Tcl and other modules should use
these routines rather than the native <strong>malloc()</strong> and
<strong>free()</strong> routines provided by the C run-time library.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong> returns a pointer to a block of at least
<em>size</em> bytes suitably aligned for any use.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Free</strong> makes the space referred to by <em>ptr</em>
available for further allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Realloc</strong> changes the size of the block pointed to
by <em>ptr</em> to <em>size</em> bytes and returns a pointer to the new
block. The contents will be unchanged up to the lesser of the new and
old sizes. The returned location may be different from <em>ptr</em>. If
<em>ptr</em> is NULL, this is equivalent to calling
<strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong> with just the <em>size</em> argument.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AttemptAlloc</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_AttemptRealloc</strong> are identical in function to
<strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Realloc</strong>, except that
<strong>Tcl_AttemptAlloc</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_AttemptRealloc</strong> will not cause the Tcl interpreter
to <strong>panic</strong> if the memory allocation fails. If the
allocation fails, these functions will return NULL. Note that on some
platforms, but not all, attempting to allocate a zero-sized block of
memory will also cause these functions to return NULL.</p>
<p>The procedures <strong>ckalloc</strong>, <strong>ckfree</strong>,
<strong>ckrealloc</strong>, <strong>attemptckalloc</strong>, and
<strong>attemptckrealloc</strong> are implemented as macros. Normally,
they are synonyms for the corresponding procedures documented on this
page. When Tcl and all modules calling Tcl are compiled with
<strong>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</strong> defined, however, these macros are
redefined to be special debugging versions of these procedures. To
support Tcl's memory debugging within a module, use the macros rather
than direct calls to <strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetMemoryInfo</strong> appends a list-of-lists of memory
stats to the provided DString. This function cannot be used in
stub-enabled extensions, and it is only available if Tcl is compiled
with the threaded memory allocator.</p>
