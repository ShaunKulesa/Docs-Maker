<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> is a procedure that is invoked by the
main programs for Tcl applications such as <strong>tclsh</strong> and
<strong>wish</strong>. Its purpose is to allow new Tcl applications to
be created without modifying the main programs provided as part of Tcl
and Tk. To create a new application you write a new version of
<strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> to replace the default version provided by
Tcl, then link your new <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> with the Tcl
library.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> is invoked by <strong>Tcl_Main</strong>
and <strong>Tk_Main</strong> after their own initialization and before
entering the main loop to process commands. Here are some examples of
things that <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> might do:</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Call initialization procedures for various packages used by the
application. Each initialization procedure adds new commands to
<em>interp</em> for its package and performs other package-specific
initialization.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Process command-line arguments, which can be accessed from the Tcl
variables <strong>argv</strong> and <strong>argv0</strong> in
<em>interp</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoke a startup script to initialize the application.</p>
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use the routines <strong>Tcl_SetStartupScript</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_GetStartupScript</strong> to set or query the file and
encoding that the active <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> or
<strong>Tk_Main</strong> routine will use as a startup script.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong> or
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. If it returns <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>
then it must leave an error message in for the interpreter's result;
otherwise the result is ignored.</p>
<p>In addition to <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong>, your application should
also contain a procedure <strong>main</strong> that calls
<strong>Tcl_Main</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Tcl_Main(argc, argv, Tcl_AppInit);</code></pre>
<p>The third argument to <strong>Tcl_Main</strong> gives the address of
the application-specific initialization procedure to invoke. This means
that you do not have to use the name <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> for
the procedure, but in practice the name is nearly always
<strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> (in versions before Tcl 7.4 the name
<strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> was implicit; there was no way to specify
the procedure explicitly). The best way to get started is to make a copy
of the file <strong>tclAppInit.c</strong> from the Tcl library or source
directory. It already contains a <strong>main</strong> procedure and a
template for <strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> that you can modify for your
application.</p>
