<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_CreateInterp</strong> procedure returns a pointer to
a Tcl_Interp structure. Callers of <strong>Tcl_CreateInterp</strong>
should use this pointer as an opaque token, suitable for nothing other
than passing back to other routines in the Tcl interface. Accessing
fields directly through the pointer as described below is no longer
supported. The supported public routines <strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_GetResult</strong>, <strong>Tcl_SetErrorLine</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_GetErrorLine</strong> must be used instead.</p>
<p>For legacy programs and extensions no longer being maintained,
compiles against the Tcl 8.6 header files are only possible with the
compiler directives</p>
<pre><code>#define USE_INTERP_RESULT</code></pre>
<p>and/or</p>
<pre><code>#define USE_INTERP_ERRORLINE</code></pre>
<p>depending on which fields of the <strong>Tcl_Interp</strong> struct
are accessed. These directives may be embedded in code or supplied via
compiler options.</p>
<p>The <em>result</em> and <em>freeProc</em> fields are used to return
results or error messages from commands. This information is returned by
command procedures back to <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>, and by
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> back to its callers. The <em>result</em> field
points to the string that represents the result or error message, and
the <em>freeProc</em> field tells how to dispose of the storage for the
string when it is not needed anymore. The easiest way for command
procedures to manipulate these fields is to call procedures like
<strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong> or <strong>Tcl_AppendResult</strong>;
they will hide all the details of managing the fields. The description
below is for those procedures that manipulate the fields directly.</p>
<p>Whenever a command procedure returns, it must ensure that the
<em>result</em> field of its interpreter points to the string being
returned by the command. The <em>result</em> field must always point to
a valid string. If a command wishes to return no result then
<em>interp-&gt;result</em> should point to an empty string. Normally,
results are assumed to be statically allocated, which means that the
contents will not change before the next time <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>
is called or some other command procedure is invoked. In this case, the
<em>freeProc</em> field must be zero. Alternatively, a command procedure
may dynamically allocate its return value (e.g. using
<strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>) and store a pointer to it in
<em>interp-&gt;result</em>. In this case, the command procedure must
also set <em>interp-&gt;freeProc</em> to the address of a procedure that
can free the value, or <strong>TCL_DYNAMIC</strong> if the storage was
allocated directly by Tcl or by a call to <strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>. If
<em>interp-&gt;freeProc</em> is non-zero, then Tcl will call
<em>freeProc</em> to free the space pointed to by
<em>interp-&gt;result</em> before it invokes the next command. If a
client procedure overwrites <em>interp-&gt;result</em> when
<em>interp-&gt;freeProc</em> is non-zero, then it is responsible for
calling <em>freeProc</em> to free the old <em>interp-&gt;result</em>
(the <strong>Tcl_FreeResult</strong> macro should be used for this
purpose).</p>
<p><em>FreeProc</em> should have arguments and result that match the
<strong>Tcl_FreeProc</strong> declaration above: it receives a single
argument which is a pointer to the result value to free. In most
applications <strong>TCL_DYNAMIC</strong> is the only non-zero value
ever used for <em>freeProc</em>. However, an application may store a
different procedure address in <em>freeProc</em> in order to use an
alternate memory allocator or in order to do other cleanup when the
result memory is freed.</p>
<p>As part of processing each command, <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>
initializes <em>interp-&gt;result</em> and <em>interp-&gt;freeProc</em>
just before calling the command procedure for the command. The
<em>freeProc</em> field will be initialized to zero, and
<em>interp-&gt;result</em> will point to an empty string. Commands that
do not return any value can simply leave the fields alone. Furthermore,
the empty string pointed to by <em>result</em> is actually part of an
array of <strong>TCL_RESULT_SIZE</strong> characters (approximately
200). If a command wishes to return a short string, it can simply copy
it to the area pointed to by <em>interp-&gt;result</em>. Or, it can use
the sprintf procedure to generate a short result string at the location
pointed to by <em>interp-&gt;result</em>.</p>
<p>It is a general convention in Tcl-based applications that the result
of an interpreter is normally in the initialized state described in the
previous paragraph. Procedures that manipulate an interpreter's result
(e.g. by returning an error) will generally assume that the result has
been initialized when the procedure is called. If such a procedure is to
be called after the result has been changed, then
<strong>Tcl_ResetResult</strong> should be called first to reset the
result to its initialized state. The direct use of
<em>interp-&gt;result</em> is strongly deprecated (see
<strong>Tcl_SetResult</strong>).</p>
<p>The <em>errorLine</em> field is valid only after
<strong>Tcl_Eval</strong> returns a <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> return
code. In this situation the <em>errorLine</em> field identifies the line
number of the command being executed when the error occurred. The line
numbers are relative to the command being executed: 1 means the first
line of the command passed to <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>, 2 means the
second line, and so on. The <em>errorLine</em> field is typically used
in conjunction with <strong>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</strong> to report
information about where an error occurred. <em>ErrorLine</em> should not
normally be modified except by <strong>Tcl_Eval</strong>.</p>
