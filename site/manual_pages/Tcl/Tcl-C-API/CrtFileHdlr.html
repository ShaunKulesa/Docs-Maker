<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

Tcl_CreateFileHandler(fd, mask, proc, clientData)

Tcl_DeleteFileHandler(fd)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Unix file descriptor for an open file or device.</p>
<p>Conditions under which <em>proc</em> should be called: OR-ed
combination of <strong>TCL_READABLE</strong>,
<strong>TCL_WRITABLE</strong>, and <strong>TCL_EXCEPTION</strong>. May
be set to 0 to temporarily disable a handler.</p>
<p>Procedure to invoke whenever the file or device indicated by
<em>file</em> meets the conditions specified by <em>mask</em>.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</strong> arranges for <em>proc</em> to
be invoked in the future whenever I/O becomes possible on a file or an
exceptional condition exists for the file. The file is indicated by
<em>fd</em>, and the conditions of interest are indicated by
<em>mask</em>. For example, if <em>mask</em> is
<strong>TCL_READABLE</strong>, <em>proc</em> will be called when the
file is readable. The callback to <em>proc</em> is made by
<strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong>, so
<strong>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</strong> is only useful in programs that
dispatch events through <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or through Tcl
commands such as <strong>vwait</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result that match the type
<strong>Tcl_FileProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_FileProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        int mask);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to
<strong>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</strong> when the callback was created.
Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to a data structure containing
application-specific information about the file. <em>Mask</em> is an
integer mask indicating which of the requested conditions actually
exists for the file; it will contain a subset of the bits in the
<em>mask</em> argument to <strong>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</strong>.</p>
<p>There may exist only one handler for a given file at a given time. If
<strong>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</strong> is called when a handler already
exists for <em>fd</em>, then the new callback replaces the information
that was previously recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteFileHandler</strong> may be called to delete the
file handler for <em>fd</em>; if no handler exists for the file given by
<em>fd</em> then the procedure has no effect.</p>
<p>The purpose of file handlers is to enable an application to respond
to events while waiting for files to become ready for I/O. For this to
work correctly, the application may need to use non-blocking I/O
operations on the files for which handlers are declared. Otherwise the
application may block if it reads or writes too much data; while waiting
for the I/O to complete the application will not be able to service
other events. Use <strong>Tcl_SetChannelOption</strong> with
<strong>-blocking</strong> to set the channel into blocking or
nonblocking mode as required.</p>
<p>Note that these interfaces are only supported by the Unix
implementation of the Tcl notifier.</p>
