<p>Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting. If non-NULL and an error
occurs, an error message is left in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p>A port number to connect to as a client or to listen on as a
server.</p>
<p>A string specifying a host name or address for the remote end of the
connection.</p>
<p>A port number for the client's end of the socket. If 0, a port number
is allocated at random.</p>
<p>A string specifying the host name or address for network interface to
use for the local end of the connection. If NULL, a default interface is
chosen.</p>
<p>If nonzero, the client socket is connected asynchronously to the
server.</p>
<p>Platform-specific handle for client TCP socket.</p>
<p>Pointer to a procedure to invoke each time a new connection is
accepted via the socket.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These functions are convenience procedures for creating channels that
communicate over TCP sockets. The operations on a channel are described
in the manual entry for <strong>Tcl_OpenFileChannel</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="tcl_opentcpclient">TCL_OPENTCPCLIENT</h2>
<p><strong>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</strong> opens a client TCP socket
connected to a <em>port</em> on a specific <em>host</em>, and returns a
channel that can be used to communicate with the server. The host to
connect to can be specified either as a domain name style name
(e.g. <strong>www.sunlabs.com</strong>), or as a string containing the
alphanumeric representation of its four-byte address
(e.g. <strong>127.0.0.1</strong>). Use the string
<strong>localhost</strong> to connect to a TCP socket on the host on
which the function is invoked.</p>
<p>The <em>myaddr</em> and <em>myport</em> arguments allow a client to
specify an address for the local end of the connection. If
<em>myaddr</em> is NULL, then an interface is chosen automatically by
the operating system. If <em>myport</em> is 0, then a port number is
chosen at random by the operating system.</p>
<p>If <em>async</em> is zero, the call to
<strong>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</strong> returns only after the client socket
has either successfully connected to the server, or the attempted
connection has failed. If <em>async</em> is nonzero the socket is
connected asynchronously and the returned channel may not yet be
connected to the server when the call to
<strong>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</strong> returns. If the channel is in
blocking mode and an input or output operation is done on the channel
before the connection is completed or fails, that operation will wait
until the connection either completes successfully or fails. If the
channel is in nonblocking mode, the input or output operation will
return immediately and a subsequent call to
<strong>Tcl_InputBlocked</strong> on the channel will return
nonzero.</p>
<p>The returned channel is opened for reading and writing. If an error
occurs in opening the socket, <strong>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</strong> returns
NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
<strong>Tcl_GetErrno</strong>. In addition, if <em>interp</em> is
non-NULL, an error message is left in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
interpreter; to register it, use <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>.
If one of the standard channels, <strong>stdin</strong>,
<strong>stdout</strong> or <strong>stderr</strong> was previously
closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>
<h2 id="tcl_maketcpclientchannel">TCL_MAKETCPCLIENTCHANNEL</h2>
<p><strong>Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel</strong> creates a
<strong>Tcl_Channel</strong> around an existing, platform specific,
handle for a client TCP socket.</p>
<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
interpreter; to register it, use <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>.
If one of the standard channels, <strong>stdin</strong>,
<strong>stdout</strong> or <strong>stderr</strong> was previously
closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>
<h2 id="tcl_opentcpserver">TCL_OPENTCPSERVER</h2>
<p><strong>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</strong> opens a TCP socket on the local
host on a specified <em>port</em> and uses the Tcl event mechanism to
accept requests from clients to connect to it. The <em>myaddr</em>
argument specifies the network interface. If <em>myaddr</em> is NULL the
special address INADDR_ANY should be used to allow connections from any
network interface. Each time a client connects to this socket, Tcl
creates a channel for the new connection and invokes <em>proc</em> with
information about the channel. <em>Proc</em> must match the following
prototype:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_TcpAcceptProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tcl_Channel channel,
        char *hostName,
        int port);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> argument will be the same as the
<em>clientData</em> argument to <strong>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</strong>,
<em>channel</em> will be the handle for the new channel,
<em>hostName</em> points to a string containing the name of the client
host making the connection, and <em>port</em> will contain the client's
port number. The new channel is opened for both input and output. If
<em>proc</em> raises an error, the connection is closed automatically.
<em>Proc</em> has no return value, but if it wishes to reject the
connection it can close <em>channel</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</strong> normally returns a pointer to a
channel representing the server socket. If an error occurs,
<strong>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</strong> returns NULL and records a POSIX
error code that can be retrieved with <strong>Tcl_GetErrno</strong>. In
addition, if the interpreter is non-NULL, an error message is left in
the interpreter's result.</p>
<p>The channel returned by <strong>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</strong> cannot be
used for either input or output. It is simply a handle for the socket
used to accept connections. The caller can close the channel to shut
down the server and disallow further connections from new clients.</p>
<p>TCP server channels operate correctly only in applications that
dispatch events through <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or through Tcl
commands such as <strong>vwait</strong>; otherwise Tcl will never notice
that a connection request from a remote client is pending.</p>
<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
interpreter; to register it, use <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>.
If one of the standard channels, <strong>stdin</strong>,
<strong>stdout</strong> or <strong>stderr</strong> was previously
closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>
<h1 id="platform-issues">PLATFORM ISSUES</h1>
<p>On Unix platforms, the socket handle is a Unix file descriptor as
returned by the <strong>socket</strong> system call. On the Windows
platform, the socket handle is a <strong>SOCKET</strong> as defined in
the WinSock API.</p>
