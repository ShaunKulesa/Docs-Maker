<p>Expression to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Pointer to location in which to store the integer value of the

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These four procedures all evaluate the expression given by the
<em>expr</em> argument and return the result in one of four different
forms. The expression can have any of the forms accepted by the
<strong>expr</strong> command. Note that these procedures have been
largely replaced by the value-based procedures
<strong>Tcl_ExprLongObj</strong>, <strong>Tcl_ExprDoubleObj</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_ExprBooleanObj</strong>, and <strong>Tcl_ExprObj</strong>.
Those value-based procedures evaluate an expression held in a Tcl value
instead of a string. The value argument can retain an internal
representation that is more efficient to execute.</p>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument refers to an interpreter used to
evaluate the expression (e.g.Â for variables and nested Tcl commands) and
to return error information.</p>
<p>For all of these procedures the return value is a standard Tcl
result: <strong>TCL_OK</strong> means the expression was successfully
evaluated, and <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> means that an error occurred
while evaluating the expression. If <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is
returned then the interpreter's result will hold a message describing
the error. If an error occurs while executing a Tcl command embedded in
the expression then that error will be returned.</p>
<p>If the expression is successfully evaluated, then its value is
returned in one of four forms, depending on which procedure is invoked.
<strong>Tcl_ExprLong</strong> stores an integer value at
<em>*longPtr</em>. If the expression's actual value is a floating-point
number, then it is truncated to an integer. If the expression's actual
value is a non-numeric string then an error is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ExprDouble</strong> stores a floating-point value at
<em>*doublePtr</em>. If the expression's actual value is an integer, it
is converted to floating-point. If the expression's actual value is a
non-numeric string then an error is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ExprBoolean</strong> stores a 0/1 integer value at
<em>*booleanPtr</em>. If the expression's actual value is an integer or
floating-point number, then they store 0 at <em>*booleanPtr</em> if the
value was zero and 1 otherwise. If the expression's actual value is a
non-numeric string then it must be one of the values accepted by
<strong>Tcl_GetBoolean</strong> such as or or else an error occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ExprString</strong> returns the value of the expression
as a string stored in the interpreter's result.</p>
