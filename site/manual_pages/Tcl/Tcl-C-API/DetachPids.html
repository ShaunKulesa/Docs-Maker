<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Number of process ids contained in the array pointed to by
<em>pidPtr</em>.</p>
<p>Address of array containing <em>numPids</em> process ids.</p>
<p>The id of the process (pipe) to wait for.</p>
<p>The result of waiting on a process (pipe). Either 0 or ECHILD.</p>
<p>The options controlling the wait. WNOHANG specifies not to wait when
checking the process.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_DetachPids</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</strong> provide a mechanism for managing
subprocesses that are running in background. These procedures are needed
because the parent of a process must eventually invoke the
<strong>waitpid</strong> kernel call (or one of a few other similar
kernel calls) to wait for the child to exit. Until the parent waits for
the child, the child's state cannot be completely reclaimed by the
system. If a parent continually creates children and doesn't wait on
them, the system's process table will eventually overflow, even if all
the children have exited.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DetachPids</strong> may be called to ask Tcl to take
responsibility for one or more processes whose process ids are contained
in the <em>pidPtr</em> array passed as argument. The caller presumably
has started these processes running in background and does not want to
have to deal with them again.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</strong> invokes the
<strong>waitpid</strong> kernel call on each of the background processes
so that its state can be cleaned up if it has exited. If the process has
not exited yet, <strong>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</strong> does not wait for
it to exit; it will check again the next time it is invoked. Tcl
automatically calls <strong>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</strong> each time the
<strong>exec</strong> command is executed, so in most cases it is not
necessary for any code outside of Tcl to invoke
<strong>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</strong>. However, if you call
<strong>Tcl_DetachPids</strong> in situations where the
<strong>exec</strong> command may never get executed, you may wish to
call <strong>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</strong> from time to time so that
background processes can be cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_WaitPid</strong> is a thin wrapper around the facilities
provided by the operating system to wait on the end of a spawned process
and to check a whether spawned process is still running. It is used by
<strong>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</strong> and the channel system to
portably access the operating system.</p>
