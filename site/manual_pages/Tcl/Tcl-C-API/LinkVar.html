<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_LinkVar</strong> uses variable traces to keep the Tcl
variable named by <em>varName</em> in sync with the C variable at the
address given by <em>addr</em>. Whenever the Tcl variable is read the
value of the C variable will be returned, and whenever the Tcl variable
is written the C variable will be updated to have the same value.
<strong>Tcl_LinkVar</strong> normally returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong>;
if an error occurs while setting up the link (e.g.Â because
<em>varName</em> is the name of array) then <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>
is returned and the interpreter's result contains an error message.</p>
<p>The <em>type</em> argument specifies the type of the C variable, and
must have one of the following values, optionally OR'ed with
<strong>TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY</strong>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_INT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>int</strong>. Any value written
into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to
<strong>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</strong>; attempts to write non-integer values
into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete
integer representations (like the empty string, '+', '-' or the
hex/octal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_UINT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>unsigned int</strong>. Any value
written into the Tcl variable must have a proper unsigned integer form
acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj</strong> and in the
platform's defined range for the <strong>unsigned int</strong> type;
attempts to write non-integer values (or values outside the range) into
<em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete integer
representations (like the empty string, '+', '-' or the hex/octal/binary
prefix) are accepted as if they are valid too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_CHAR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>char</strong>. Any value written
into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to
<strong>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</strong> and be in the range of the
<strong>char</strong> datatype; attempts to write non-integer or
out-of-range values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl
errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string, '+',
'-' or the hex/octal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid
too.</p>

<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>short</strong>. Any value written

too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_USHORT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>unsigned short</strong>. Any value

prefix) are accepted as if they are valid too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_LONG</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>long</strong>. Any value written
into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to
<strong>Tcl_GetLongFromObj</strong>; attempts to write non-integer or
out-of-range values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl

too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_ULONG</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>unsigned long</strong>. Any value
written into the Tcl variable must have a proper unsigned integer form
acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj</strong> and in the
platform's defined range for the <strong>unsigned long</strong> type;

</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_DOUBLE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>double</strong>. Any value written
into the Tcl variable must have a proper real form acceptable to
<strong>Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj</strong>; attempts to write non-real values
into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete
integer or real representations (like the empty string, '.', '+', '-' or
the hex/octal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_FLOAT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>float</strong>. Any value written
into the Tcl variable must have a proper real form acceptable to
<strong>Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj</strong> and must be within the range
acceptable for a <strong>float</strong>; attempts to write non-real
values (or values outside the range) into <em>varName</em> will be
rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete integer or real representations
(like the empty string, '.', '+', '-' or the hex/octal/binary prefix)
are accepted as if they are valid too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_WIDE_INT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>Tcl_WideInt</strong> (which is an
integer type at least 64-bits wide on all platforms that can support
it.) Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer
form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj</strong>; attempts to
write non-integer values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl
errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string, '+',
'-' or the hex/octal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid
too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_WIDE_UINT</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>Tcl_WideUInt</strong> (which is an
unsigned integer type at least 64-bits wide on all platforms that can
support it.) Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
unsigned integer form acceptable to
<strong>Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj</strong> (it will be cast to unsigned);
attempts to write non-integer values into <em>varName</em> will be
rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the
empty string, '+', '-' or the hex/octal/binary prefix) are accepted as
if they are valid too.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_BOOLEAN</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>int</strong>. If its value is zero
then it will read from Tcl as otherwise it will read from Tcl as
Whenever <em>varName</em> is modified, the C variable will be set to a 0
or 1 value. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
boolean form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj</strong>;
attempts to write non-boolean values into <em>varName</em> will be
rejected with Tcl errors.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TCL_LINK_STRING</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The C variable is of type <strong>char *</strong>. If its value is
not NULL then it must be a pointer to a string allocated with
<strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong> or <strong>ckalloc</strong>. Whenever the Tcl
variable is modified the current C string will be freed and new memory
will be allocated to hold a copy of the variable's new value. If the C
variable contains a NULL pointer then the Tcl variable will read as</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the <strong>TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY</strong> flag is present in
<em>type</em> then the variable will be read-only from Tcl, so that its
value can only be changed by modifying the C variable. Attempts to write
the variable from Tcl will be rejected with errors.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_UnlinkVar</strong> removes the link previously set up for
the variable given by <em>varName</em>. If there does not exist a link
for <em>varName</em> then the procedure has no effect.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong> may be invoked after the C
variable has changed to force the Tcl variable to be updated
immediately. In many cases this procedure is not needed, since any
attempt to read the Tcl variable will return the latest value of the C
variable. However, if a trace has been set on the Tcl variable (such as
a Tk widget that wishes to display the value of the variable), the trace
will not trigger when the C variable has changed.
<strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong> ensures that any traces on the Tcl
variable are invoked.</p>
<p>Note that, as with any call to a Tcl interpreter,
<strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong> must be called from the same thread
that created the interpreter. The safest mechanism is to ensure that the
C variable is only ever updated from the same thread that created the
interpreter (possibly in response to an event posted with
<strong>Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent</strong>), but when it is necessary to
update the variable in a separate thread, it is advised that
<strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong> be used to indicate to the thread hosting
the interpreter that it is ready to run
<strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong>.</p>
