<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Objects are typed entities that have a set of operations ("methods")
associated with them. Classes are objects that can manufacture objects.
Each class can be viewed as an object itself; the object view can be
retrieved using <strong>Tcl_GetClassAsObject</strong> which always
returns the object when applied to a non-destroyed class, and an object
can be viewed as a class with the aid of the
<strong>Tcl_GetObjectAsClass</strong> (which either returns the class,
or NULL if the object is not a class). An object may be looked up using
the <strong>Tcl_GetObjectFromObj</strong> function, which either returns
an object or NULL (with an error message in the interpreter result) if
the object cannot be found. The correct way to look up a class by name
is to look up the object with that name, and then to use
<strong>Tcl_GetObjectAsClass</strong>.</p>
<p>Every object has its own command and namespace associated with it.
The command may be retrieved using the
<strong>Tcl_GetObjectCommand</strong> function, the name of the object
(and hence the name of the command) with
<strong>Tcl_GetObjectName</strong>, and the namespace may be retrieved
using the <strong>Tcl_GetObjectNamespace</strong> function. Note that
the Tcl_Obj reference returned by <strong>Tcl_GetObjectName</strong> is
a shared reference. You can also get whether the object has been marked
for deletion with <strong>Tcl_ObjectDeleted</strong> (it returns true if
deletion of the object has begun); this can be useful during the
processing of methods.</p>
<p>Instances of classes are created using
<strong>Tcl_NewObjectInstance</strong>, which creates an object from any
class (and which is internally called by both the
<strong>create</strong> and <strong>new</strong> methods of the
<strong>oo::class</strong> class). It takes parameters that optionally
give the name of the object and namespace to create, and which describe
the arguments to pass to the class's constructor (if any). The result of
the function will be either a reference to the newly created object, or
NULL if the creation failed (when an error message will be left in the
interpreter result). In addition, objects may be copied by using
<strong>Tcl_CopyObjectInstance</strong> which creates a copy of an
object without running any constructors.</p>
<p>Note that the lifetime management of objects is handled internally
within TclOO, and does not use <strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong>. <em>It is
not safe to put a</em> Tcl_Object handle in a C structure with a
lifespan different to the object; you should use the object's command
name (as retrieved with <strong>Tcl_GetObjectName</strong>) instead. It
is safe to use a Tcl_Object handle for the lifespan of a call of a
method on that object; handles do not become invalid while there is an
outstanding call on their object (even if the only operation guaranteed
to be safe on them is <strong>Tcl_ObjectDeleted</strong>; the other
operations are only guaranteed to work on non-deleted objects).</p>
<h1 id="object-and-class-metadata">OBJECT AND CLASS METADATA</h1>
<p>Every object and every class may have arbitrary amounts of metadata
attached to it, which the object or class attaches no meaning to beyond
what is described in a Tcl_ObjectMetadataType structure instance.
Metadata to be attached is described by the type of the metadata (given
in the <em>metaTypePtr</em> argument) and an arbitrary pointer (the
<em>metadata</em> argument) that are given to
<strong>Tcl_ObjectSetMetadata</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_ClassSetMetadata</strong>, and a particular piece of
metadata can be retrieved given its type using
<strong>Tcl_ObjectGetMetadata</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_ClassGetMetadata</strong>. If the <em>metadata</em>
parameter to either <strong>Tcl_ObjectSetMetadata</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_ClassSetMetadata</strong> is NULL, the metadata is removed
if it was attached, and the results of
<strong>Tcl_ObjectGetMetadata</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_ClassGetMetadata</strong> are NULL if the given type of
metadata was not attached. It is not an error to request or remove a
piece of metadata that was not attached.</p>
<h2 id="tcl_objectmetadatatype-structure">TCL_OBJECTMETADATATYPE
STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>The contents of the Tcl_ObjectMetadataType structure are as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef const struct {
    int version;
    const char *name;
    Tcl_ObjectMetadataDeleteProc *deleteProc;
    Tcl_CloneProc *cloneProc;
} Tcl_ObjectMetadataType;</code></pre>
<p>The <em>version</em> field allows for future expansion of the
structure, and should always be declared equal to
TCL_OO_METADATA_VERSION_CURRENT. The <em>name</em> field provides a
human-readable name for the type, and is reserved for debugging.</p>
<p>The <em>deleteProc</em> field gives a function of type
Tcl_ObjectMetadataDeleteProc that is used to delete a particular piece
of metadata, and is called when the attached metadata is replaced or
removed; the field must not be NULL.</p>
<p>The <em>cloneProc</em> field gives a function that is used to copy a
piece of metadata (used when a copy of an object is created using
<strong>Tcl_CopyObjectInstance</strong>); if NULL, the metadata will be
just directly copied.</p>
<h2
id="tcl_objectmetadatadeleteproc-function-signature">TCL_OBJECTMETADATADELETEPROC
FUNCTION SIGNATURE</h2>
<p>Functions matching this signature are used to delete metadata
associated with a class or object.</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_ObjectMetadataDeleteProc(
        ClientData metadata);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>metadata</em> argument gives the address of the metadata to
be deleted.</p>
<h2 id="tcl_cloneproc-function-signature">TCL_CLONEPROC FUNCTION
SIGNATURE</h2>
<p>Functions matching this signature are used to create copies of
metadata associated with a class or object.</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_CloneProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        ClientData srcMetadata,
        ClientData *dstMetadataPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>interp</em> argument gives a place to write an error message
when the attempt to clone the object is to fail, in which case the clone
procedure must also return TCL_ERROR; it should return TCL_OK otherwise.
The <em>srcMetadata</em> argument gives the address of the metadata to
be cloned, and the cloned metadata should be written into the variable
pointed to by <em>dstMetadataPtr</em>; a NULL should be written if the
metadata is to not be cloned but the overall object copy operation is
still to succeed.</p>
<h1 id="object-method-name-mapping">OBJECT METHOD NAME MAPPING</h1>
<p>It is possible to control, on a per-object basis, what methods are
invoked when a particular method is invoked. Normally this is done by
looking up the method name in the object and then in the class
hierarchy, but fine control of exactly what the value used to perform
the look up is afforded through the ability to set a method name mapper
callback via <strong>Tcl_ObjectSetMethodNameMapper</strong> (and its
introspection counterpart,
<strong>Tcl_ObjectGetMethodNameMapper</strong>, which returns the
current mapper). The current mapper (if any) is invoked immediately
before looking up what chain of method implementations is to be
used.</p>
<h2
id="tcl_objectmapmethodnameproc-function-signature">TCL_OBJECTMAPMETHODNAMEPROC
FUNCTION SIGNATURE</h2>
<p>The <em>Tcl_ObjectMapMethodNameProc</em> callback is defined as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>typedef int Tcl_ObjectMapMethodNameProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Object object,
        Tcl_Class *startClsPtr,
        Tcl_Obj *methodNameObj);</code></pre>
<p>If the result is TCL_OK, the remapping is assumed to have been done.
If the result is TCL_ERROR, an error message will have been left in
<em>interp</em> and the method call will fail. If the result is
TCL_BREAK, the standard method name lookup rules will be used; the
behavior of other result codes is currently undefined. The
<em>object</em> parameter says which object is being processed. The
<em>startClsPtr</em> parameter points to a variable that contains the
first class to provide a definition in the method chain to process, or
NULL if the whole chain is to be processed (the argument itself is never
NULL); this variable may be updated by the callback. The
<em>methodNameObj</em> parameter gives an unshared object containing the
name of the method being invoked, as provided by the user; this object
may be updated by the callback.</p>
