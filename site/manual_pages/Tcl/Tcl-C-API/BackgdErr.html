<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter in which the exception occurred.</p>
<p>The exceptional return code to be reported.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This procedure is typically invoked when a Tcl exception (any return
code other than TCL_OK) occurs during such as executing an event
handler. When such an exception occurs, the condition is reported to Tcl
or to a widget or some other C code, and there is not usually any
obvious way for that code to report the exception to the user. In these
cases the code calls <strong>Tcl_BackgroundException</strong> with an
<em>interp</em> argument identifying the interpreter in which the
exception occurred, and a <em>code</em> argument holding the return code
value of the exception. The state of the interpreter, including any
error message in the interpreter result, and the values of any entries
in the return options dictionary, is captured and saved.
<strong>Tcl_BackgroundException</strong> then arranges for the event
loop to invoke at some later time the command registered in that
interpreter to handle background errors by the <strong>interp
bgerror</strong> command, passing the captured values as arguments. The
registered handler command is meant to report the exception in an
application-specific fashion. The handler command receives two
arguments, the result of the interp, and the return options of the
interp at the time the error occurred. If the application registers no
handler command, the default handler command will attempt to call
<strong>bgerror</strong> to report the error. If an error condition
arises while invoking the handler command, then
<strong>Tcl_BackgroundException</strong> reports the error itself by
printing a message on the standard error file.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_BackgroundException</strong> does not invoke the handler
command immediately because this could potentially interfere with
scripts that are in process at the time the error occurred. Instead, it
invokes the handler command later as an idle callback.</p>
<p>It is possible for many background exceptions to accumulate before
the handler command is invoked. When this happens, each of the
exceptions is processed in order. However, if the handler command
returns a break exception, then all remaining error reports for the
interpreter are skipped.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_BackgroundError</strong> routine is an older and
simpler interface useful when the exception code reported is
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>. It is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>Tcl_BackgroundException(interp, TCL_ERROR);</code></pre>
