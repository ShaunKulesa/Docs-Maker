<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter where package is needed or available.</p>
<p>Name of package.</p>
<p>A version string consisting of one or more decimal numbers separated
by dots.</p>
<p>Non-zero means that only the particular version specified by
<em>version</em> is acceptable. Zero means that newer versions than
<em>version</em> are also acceptable as long as they have the same major
version number as <em>version</em>.</p>
<p>Arbitrary value to be associated with the package.</p>
<p>Pointer to place to store the value associated with the matching
package. It is only changed if the pointer is not NULL and the function
completed successfully. The storage can be any pointer type with the
same size as a void pointer.</p>
<p>Number of requirements.</p>
<p>Array of requirements.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package and
version management facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_PkgRequire</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>package
require</strong> command, <strong>Tcl_PkgPresent</strong> is equivalent
to the <strong>package present</strong> command, and
<strong>Tcl_PkgProvide</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>package
provide</strong> command.</p>
<p>See the documentation for the Tcl commands for details on what these
procedures do.</p>
<p>If <strong>Tcl_PkgPresent</strong> or <strong>Tcl_PkgRequire</strong>
complete successfully they return a pointer to the version string for
the version of the package that is provided in the interpreter (which
may be different than <em>version</em>); if an error occurs they return
NULL and leave an error message in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_PkgProvide</strong> returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong> if it
completes successfully; if an error occurs it returns
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> and leaves an error message in the
interpreter's result.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_PkgProvideEx</strong>, <strong>Tcl_PkgPresentEx</strong>
and <strong>Tcl_PkgRequireEx</strong> allow the setting and retrieving
of the client data associated with the package. In all other respects
they are equivalent to the matching functions.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_PkgRequireProc</strong> is the form of <strong>package
require</strong> handling multiple requirements. The other forms are
present for backward compatibility and translate their invocations to
this form.</p>
