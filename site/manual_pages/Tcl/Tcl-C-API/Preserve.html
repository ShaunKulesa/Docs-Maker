<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These three procedures help implement a simple reference count
mechanism for managing storage. They are designed to solve a problem
having to do with widget deletion, but are also useful in many other
situations. When a widget is deleted, its widget record (the structure
holding information specific to the widget) must be returned to the
storage allocator. However, it is possible that the widget record is in
active use by one of the procedures on the stack at the time of the
deletion. This can happen, for example, if the command associated with a
button widget causes the button to be destroyed: an X event causes an
event-handling C procedure in the button to be invoked, which in turn
causes the button's associated Tcl command to be executed, which in turn
causes the button to be deleted, which in turn causes the button's
widget record to be de-allocated. Unfortunately, when the Tcl command
returns, the button's event-handling procedure will need to reference
the button's widget record. Because of this, the widget record must not
be freed as part of the deletion, but must be retained until the
event-handling procedure has finished with it. In other situations where
the widget is deleted, it may be possible to free the widget record
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Release</strong>
implement short-term reference counts for their <em>clientData</em>
argument. The <em>clientData</em> argument identifies an object and
usually consists of the address of a structure. The reference counts
guarantee that an object will not be freed until each call to
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> for the object has been matched by calls
to <strong>Tcl_Release</strong>. There may be any number of unmatched
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> calls in effect at once.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_EventuallyFree</strong> is invoked to free up its
<em>clientData</em> argument. It checks to see if there are unmatched
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> calls for the object. If not, then
<strong>Tcl_EventuallyFree</strong> calls <em>freeProc</em> immediately.
Otherwise <strong>Tcl_EventuallyFree</strong> records the fact that
<em>clientData</em> needs eventually to be freed. When all calls to
<strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> have been matched with calls to
<strong>Tcl_Release</strong> then <em>freeProc</em> will be called by
<strong>Tcl_Release</strong> to do the cleanup.</p>
<p>All the work of freeing the object is carried out by
<em>freeProc</em>. <em>FreeProc</em> must have arguments and result that
match the type <strong>Tcl_FreeProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(
        char *blockPtr);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>blockPtr</em> argument to <em>freeProc</em> will be the same
as the <em>clientData</em> argument to
<strong>Tcl_EventuallyFree</strong>. The type of <em>blockPtr</em>
(<strong>char *</strong>) is different than the type of the
<em>clientData</em> argument to <strong>Tcl_EventuallyFree</strong> for
historical reasons, but the value is the same.</p>
<p>When the <em>clientData</em> argument to
<strong>Tcl_EventuallyFree</strong> refers to storage allocated and
returned by a prior call to <strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>,
<strong>ckalloc</strong>, or another function of the Tcl library, then
the <em>freeProc</em> argument should be given the special value of
<strong>TCL_DYNAMIC</strong>.</p>
<p>This mechanism can be used to solve the problem described above by
placing <strong>Tcl_Preserve</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Release</strong>
calls around actions that may cause undesired storage re-allocation. The
mechanism is intended only for short-term use (i.e.Â while procedures are
pending on the stack); it will not work efficiently as a mechanism for
long-term reference counts. The implementation does not depend in any
way on the internal structure of the objects being freed; it keeps the
reference counts in a separate structure.</p>
