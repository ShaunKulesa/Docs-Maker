<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Major version number of the Tcl library.</p>
<p>Minor version number of the Tcl library.</p>
<p>The patch level of the Tcl library (or alpha or beta number).</p>
<p>The type of release, also indicates the type of patch level. Can be
one of <strong>TCL_ALPHA_RELEASE</strong>,
<strong>TCL_BETA_RELEASE</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_FINAL_RELEASE</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetVersion</strong> should be used to query the version
number of the Tcl library at runtime. This is useful when using a
dynamically loaded Tcl library or when writing a stubs-aware extension.
For instance, if you write an extension that is linked against the Tcl
stubs library, it could be loaded into a program linked to an older
version of Tcl than you expected. Use <strong>Tcl_GetVersion</strong> to
verify that fact, and possibly to change the behavior of your
extension.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetVersion</strong> accepts NULL for any of the
arguments. For instance if you do not care about the <em>patchLevel</em>
of the library, pass a NULL for the <em>patchLevel</em> argument.</p>
