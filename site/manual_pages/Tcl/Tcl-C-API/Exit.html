<p>Provides information about why the application or thread exited.
Exact meaning may be platform-specific. 0 usually means a normal exit,
any nonzero value usually means that an error occurred.</p>
<p>Procedure to invoke before exiting application, or (for

application exit procedure.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The procedures described here provide a graceful mechanism to end the
execution of a <strong>Tcl</strong> application. Exit handlers are
invoked to cleanup the application's state before ending the execution
of <strong>Tcl</strong> code.</p>
<p>Invoke <strong>Tcl_Exit</strong> to end a <strong>Tcl</strong>
application and to exit from this process. This procedure is invoked by
the <strong>exit</strong> command, and can be invoked anyplace else to
terminate the application. No-one should ever invoke the
<strong>exit</strong> system procedure directly; always invoke
<strong>Tcl_Exit</strong> instead, so that it can invoke exit handlers.
Note that if other code invokes <strong>exit</strong> system procedure
directly, or otherwise causes the application to terminate without
calling <strong>Tcl_Exit</strong>, the exit handlers will not be run.
<strong>Tcl_Exit</strong> internally invokes the <strong>exit</strong>
system call, thus it never returns control to its caller. If an
application exit handler has been installed (see
<strong>Tcl_SetExitProc</strong>), that handler is invoked with an
argument consisting of the exit status (cast to ClientData); the
application exit handler should not return control to Tcl.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> is similar to <strong>Tcl_Exit</strong>
except that it does not exit from the current process. It is useful for
cleaning up when a process is finished using <strong>Tcl</strong> but
wishes to continue executing, and when <strong>Tcl</strong> is used in a
dynamically loaded extension that is about to be unloaded. Your code
should always invoke <strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> when
<strong>Tcl</strong> is being unloaded, to ensure proper cleanup.
<strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> can be safely called more than once.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_ExitThread</strong> is used to terminate the current
thread and invoke per-thread exit handlers. This finalization is done by
<strong>Tcl_FinalizeThread</strong>, which you can call if you just want
to clean up per-thread state and invoke the thread exit handlers.
<strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> calls <strong>Tcl_FinalizeThread</strong>
for the current thread automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_CreateExitHandler</strong> arranges for <em>proc</em> to
be invoked by <strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_Exit</strong>. <strong>Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler</strong>
arranges for <em>proc</em> to be invoked by
<strong>Tcl_FinalizeThread</strong> and <strong>Tcl_ExitThread</strong>.
This provides a hook for cleanup operations such as flushing buffers and
freeing global memory. <em>Proc</em> should match the type
<strong>Tcl_ExitProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_ExitProc(
        ClientData clientData);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> parameter to <em>proc</em> is a copy of the
<em>clientData</em> argument given to
<strong>Tcl_CreateExitHandler</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler</strong> when the callback was
created. Typically, <em>clientData</em> points to a data structure
containing application-specific information about what to do in
<em>proc</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler</strong> may be called to delete a
previously-created exit handler. It removes the handler indicated by
<em>proc</em> and <em>clientData</em> so that no call to <em>proc</em>
will be made. If no such handler exists then
<strong>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler</strong> does nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Exit</strong> execute
all registered exit handlers, in reverse order from the order in which
they were registered. This matches the natural order in which extensions
are loaded and unloaded; if extension <strong>A</strong> loads extension
<strong>B</strong>, it usually unloads <strong>B</strong> before it
itself is unloaded. If extension <strong>A</strong> registers its exit
handlers before loading extension <strong>B</strong>, this ensures that
any exit handlers for <strong>B</strong> will be executed before the
exit handlers for <strong>A</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> and <strong>Tcl_Exit</strong> call
<strong>Tcl_FinalizeThread</strong> and the thread exit handlers
<em>after</em> the process-wide exit handlers. This is because thread
finalization shuts down the I/O channel system, so any attempt at I/O by
the global exit handlers will vanish into the bitbucket.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetExitProc</strong> installs an application exit
handler, returning the previously-installed application exit handler or
NULL if no application handler was installed. If an application exit
handler is installed, that exit handler takes over complete
responsibility for finalization of Tcl's subsystems via
<strong>Tcl_Finalize</strong> at an appropriate time. The argument
passed to <em>proc</em> when it is invoked will be the exit status code
(as passed to <strong>Tcl_Exit</strong>) cast to a ClientData value.</p>
