<p>If needed, this dynamic string is used to store the new file name. At
the time of the call it should be uninitialized or free. The caller must

stored here.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This utility procedure translates a file name to a platform-specific
form which, after being converted to the appropriate encoding, is
suitable for passing to the local operating system. In particular, it
converts network names into native form and does tilde substitution.</p>
<p>However, with the advent of the newer
<strong>Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_FSGetNativePath</strong>, there is no longer any need to use
this procedure. In particular, <strong>Tcl_FSGetNativePath</strong>
performs all the necessary translation and encoding conversion, is
virtual-filesystem aware, and caches the native result for faster
repeated calls. Finally <strong>Tcl_FSGetNativePath</strong> does not
require you to free anything afterwards.</p>
<p>If <strong>Tcl_TranslateFileName</strong> has to do tilde
substitution or translate the name then it uses the dynamic string at
<em>*bufferPtr</em> to hold the new string it generates. After
<strong>Tcl_TranslateFileName</strong> returns a non-NULL result, the
caller must eventually invoke <strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong> to free
any information placed in <em>*bufferPtr</em>. The caller need not know
whether or not <strong>Tcl_TranslateFileName</strong> actually used the
string; <strong>Tcl_TranslateFileName</strong> initializes
<em>*bufferPtr</em> even if it does not use it, so the call to
<strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong> will be safe in either case.</p>
<p>If an error occurs (e.g.Â because there was no user by the given name)
then NULL is returned and an error message will be left in the
interpreter's result. When an error occurs,
<strong>Tcl_TranslateFileName</strong> frees the dynamic string itself
so that the caller need not call <strong>Tcl_DStringFree</strong>.</p>
<p>The caller is responsible for making sure that the interpreter's
result has its default empty value when
<strong>Tcl_TranslateFileName</strong> is invoked.</p>
