<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tcl_GetAssocData, Tcl_SetAssocData, Tcl_DeleteAssocData - manage
associations of string keys and user specified data with Tcl
interpreters</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

ClientData
Tcl_GetAssocData(interp, key, delProcPtr)

Tcl_SetAssocData(interp, key, delProc, clientData)

Tcl_DeleteAssocData(interp, key)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Interpreter in which to execute the specified command.</p>
<p>Key for association with which to store data or from which to delete
or retrieve data. Typically the module prefix for a package.</p>
<p>Procedure to call when <em>interp</em> is deleted.</p>
<p>Pointer to location in which to store address of current deletion
procedure for association. Ignored if NULL.</p>
<p>Arbitrary one-word value associated with the given key in this
interpreter. This data is owned by the caller.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures allow extensions to associate their own data with a
Tcl interpreter. An association consists of a string key, typically the
name of the extension, and a one-word value, which is typically a
pointer to a data structure holding data specific to the extension. Tcl
makes no interpretation of either the key or the value for an
association.</p>
<p>Storage management is facilitated by storing with each association a
procedure to call when the interpreter is deleted. This procedure can
dispose of the storage occupied by the client's data in any way it sees
fit.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_SetAssocData</strong> creates an association between a
string key and a user specified datum in the given interpreter. If there
is already an association with the given <em>key</em>,
<strong>Tcl_SetAssocData</strong> overwrites it with the new
information. It is up to callers to organize their use of names to avoid
conflicts, for example, by using package names as the keys. If the
<em>deleteProc</em> argument is non-NULL it specifies the address of a
procedure to invoke if the interpreter is deleted before the association
is deleted. <em>DeleteProc</em> should have arguments and result that
match the type <strong>Tcl_InterpDeleteProc</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef void Tcl_InterpDeleteProc(
        ClientData clientData,
        Tcl_Interp *interp);</code></pre>
<p>When <em>deleteProc</em> is invoked the <em>clientData</em> and
<em>interp</em> arguments will be the same as the corresponding
arguments passed to <strong>Tcl_SetAssocData</strong>. The deletion
procedure will <em>not</em> be invoked if the association is deleted
before the interpreter is deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_GetAssocData</strong> returns the datum stored in the
association with the specified key in the given interpreter, and if the
<em>delProcPtr</em> field is non-<strong>NULL</strong>, the address
indicated by it gets the address of the delete procedure stored with
this association. If no association with the specified key exists in the
given interpreter <strong>Tcl_GetAssocData</strong> returns
<strong>NULL</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_DeleteAssocData</strong> deletes an association with a
specified key in the given interpreter. Then it calls the deletion
procedure.</p>
