<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj - save command on history list before
evaluating</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;

int
Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj(interp, cmdPtr, flags)</code></pre>
<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>Tcl interpreter in which to evaluate command.</p>
<p>Points to a Tcl value containing a command (or sequence of commands)
to execute.</p>
<p>An OR'ed combination of flag bits. <strong>TCL_NO_EVAL</strong> means
record the command but do not evaluate it.
<strong>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</strong> means evaluate the command at global
level instead of the current stack level.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</strong> is invoked to record a command
as an event on the history list and then execute it using
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> (or <strong>Tcl_GlobalEvalObj</strong> if
the <strong>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</strong> bit is set in <em>flags</em>). It
returns a completion code such as <strong>TCL_OK</strong> just like
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>, as well as a result value containing
additional information (a result value or error message) that can be
retrieved using <strong>Tcl_GetObjResult</strong>. If you do not want
the command recorded on the history list then you should invoke
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong> instead of
<strong>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</strong>. Normally
<strong>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj</strong> is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to allow the
user to re-issue recently invoked commands. If the <em>flags</em>
argument contains the <strong>TCL_NO_EVAL</strong> bit then the command
is recorded without being evaluated.</p>
